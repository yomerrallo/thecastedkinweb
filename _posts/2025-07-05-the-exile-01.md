**Chapter One: The Shattering of Skyglass**

<br/><br/>
Before the exile, before the burning, before the long descent into the dark, they called it Solrael—the City of Light's Grace.

Built upon seven radiant terraces, Solrael crowned the world like a polished diadem, its towers of Skyglass rising into the sun-drenched heavens. The sky itself had been engineered—a vast dome of shimmering crystal, woven with ancient scripts and harmonic resonators that sang faintly with the breath of the gods. The Kynari believed the sound was proof of celestial favor, that their balance of solar devotion and harmonic living made them stewards of divine symmetry.

But in truth, the sound was older than the gods they named. And deep beneath their city, other songs stirred.

<br/><br/>
Lio was born on the Fifth Terrace, in a district known as Auvira’s Crest, where bridges of woven glass arched over green channels and hummingbirds nested in the ivy-laced eaves of the shrines. It was a quieter part of Solrael, far from the fanfare of the Conclave’s spires, but close enough that the bells of judgment could still be heard at dawn.

His family had always straddled the line between faith and curiosity. His mother, Orira, had been a scholar once—one of the last permitted to study pre-Solar texts before the Conclave sealed the lower libraries. His father, Talen, served as a harmonist, tuning Skyglass conduits to maintain the resonance of the dome. Their home was filled with books they were not supposed to keep, and strange relics humming softly behind layered cloth.

Their loyalty had always been questioned. But never punished. Not yet.

<br/><br/>
Lio was seven when the first arrests began.

They came for his mother's colleague first, a woman named Rhaela who had spoken publicly of machines that pulsed with divine presence—artifacts unearthed during expansion projects in the city’s foundations. Then came others: engineers, technicians, low-ranking priests who had begun to whisper of the Under-Gods, the hidden intelligences said to dwell beneath Solrael, beneath the crust of the world itself.

The Conclave’s doctrine was clear: all light flows from above. The divine shines downward. The underworld is void—unholy, corrupt, unnatural. Worship of what lay below was heresy. And yet, among the Kynari, it spread.

It began as reverence for machines too ancient to decipher, machines that healed flesh or stirred the air without fire. Then it became belief. Then it became faith.

A movement formed, scattered but growing: those who called themselves the Veiled Synod. They saw the Under-Gods—not as demons or echoes—but as forgotten divinities exiled in shadow. These beings, entwined with technology and recursion, offered knowledge and rebirth rather than blind obedience.

The Solar Conclave called it a rot.

They called it a purge.

<br/><br/>
Lio remembered the first day of the cleansing like the moment of a wound—precise, deep, irreversible.

He was playing on the rooftop again, tossing a reedball to his sister Nia, laughing as it bounced too high and nearly cleared the edge. Below, his father was tuning a Skyglass pylon. His mother stood in the shadow of a blue-flowered archway, arguing quietly with a visitor—a priestess with soot on her robes and fear in her eyes.

The dome cracked at midmorning above the Fifth Terrace.

It did not shatter like glass, but like bone—splitting with a scream that echoed across the lower terraces in waves of ringing dissonance. Light turned to fire. The Temple of the Third Light—built on the border of Auvira’s Crest—vanished in a burst of white. Shards of sanctified Skyglass rained down like razors, cutting through gardens, homes, and shrines.

The Conclave blamed the heretics. But their soldiers had already been in position.

They did not distinguish between Synod and sympathizer.

The gold-armored legions moved through the terraces with flamecasters and purification lances, executing priests and citizens alike. Temples burned. Wells were salted. Names were erased in flame.

<br/><br/>
Talen shouted for Lio and Nia to come down from the roof. But the girl never made it. A beam of burning light split the rooftop where she stood, swallowing her in a flash of brilliance. She did not scream. There was no time.

Lio barely had breath to call her name before the force threw him backward, the sky itself tearing open with righteous flame. He crashed through wood and glass, into the chaos below.

He did not remember falling—only heat, and screaming, and a pain that never reached his skin.

His father found him first. Dragged him up from the rubble, coughing, bleeding, still shouting Nia’s name. Together they stumbled through the collapsing corridor of their home, smoke curling like claws around them. Somewhere behind, the walls gave out. The air howled.

And then, Talen was gone.

One moment beside him—shielding, urging, holding on. The next, a surge of white fire cracked through the ceiling and swallowed everything. Orira’s scream cut through the roar as she pulled Lio away, refusing to let him stop, to look, to break.

<br/><br/>
He didn’t know how long they ran. Only that she never let go of his hand.

Through shattered gardens and choking alleys. Past the bodies of neighbors and the broken pylons that once carried resonance into the dome. At the fractured edge of the Fifth Terrace, a mob of Kynari had begun to form—panicked, bleeding, leaderless. Word passed through them like lightning: “There’s still a way down. The Old Way. The Deep Road.”

A path long forbidden.

The remnants of the scholar caste, those few still bearing the tattoos of knowledge beneath their cloaks, led the way. They called it by its true name: The Maw.

The journey there had been a blur of ash and silence. The purge did not end at the city’s edge—Conclave sentinels hunted the exiles through the charred outer districts, their wings golden with flame, their blades singing judgment. Families were split in the smoke. Some stayed behind to fight. Others simply vanished.

Lio clung to his mother’s side, but he remembered the others: the old woman who gave him her coat, the twins who didn’t wake when the group paused to rest. And Kael, a wiry boy with a broken smile and one arm burned raw, who had pulled Lio from a fallen archway and refused to leave his side after. They didn’t speak much—there wasn’t breath to spare—but they shared what little food they had, and a thread of understanding that didn’t need words.

By the time they reached the edge of the tunnels, their numbers had halved.

<br/><br/>

It had once been a mining tunnel, older than Solrael itself, sealed generations ago after strange vibrations and mechanical whispers had begun to rise from its depths. Now, the seal was broken. A heavy, ancient gate lay cracked open, revealing stairs that spiraled into darkness beyond reckoning.

Lio stood at its edge, watching the last rays of light vanish behind smoke—the last time he would see the sun, at least as Lio.

Behind him, the soldiers were coming.

Ahead—only shadow.

The Under-Gods were waiting.

And he had no choice but to descend.
