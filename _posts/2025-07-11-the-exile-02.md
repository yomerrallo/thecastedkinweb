**Chapter Two: Descent into the Maw**

<br/><br/>
They called it the Maw, though none knew who had named it first.

A tunnel not carved but exhaled — walls smooth as melted stone, flecked with glimmering veins that pulsed faintly beneath the surface, as if the rock remembered fire. The stairs wound down endlessly, slick with condensation and muffled sound, swallowing light like breath.

Lio stayed near the center of the group, his hand often brushing Kael’s burned arm or his mother’s sleeve — needing the contact but rarely speaking. No one spoke much. Not after the fourth day.

The deeper they went, the more the silence pressed in. It wasn’t just the loss of voices — it was the way the air changed. Sound didn’t travel properly. It bent. Sometimes it came back wrong, or too late, or not at all.
The scholar leading them — a gaunt man with lightless eyes who others called Sayren — began marking the hours with an old brass dial that ran off heat. He warned them early: Don’t trust the tunnels. Trust the warmth. The Maw forgets time, but the body does not.

<br/><br/>
Food ran low by the fifth day. The sick and elderly slowed. On the sixth, a man named Belen collapsed near a runed alcove and begged to be left. No one argued. Orira gave him her last ration of honeyroot. He wept as they left him behind.

They passed bioluminescent growths on the seventh day. Pale fungus bloomed like coral along the walls, casting cold, eerie hues across the group. It wasn't natural — but it wasn't hostile either. Not yet.

Kael touched one briefly, said it hummed when he closed his eyes. Lio wasn’t sure if it was a joke. He didn’t laugh.

<br/><br/>
By the second week, they began seeing bones.

Not human, not animal — not anything with symmetry. Spines that branched instead of stacking. Skulls with eyes on the underside. Ribcages woven into lattices too delicate for predators. Orira sketched one briefly before the group pulled her away. Sayren said they were relics of a forgotten ecology. Perhaps precursors. Perhaps cousins of something still alive.

Lio dreamed of them that night, curled beside Kael near a vent that hissed warm air.

The dream had no beginning — he was simply in it, walking. A forest of bone and lattice, stalks and spirals, some no taller than his chest, others rising out of sight into an endless, dim canopy. The air felt thick, but dry, like breathing powdered glass. The bones vibrated softly. At first like wind, then like song, then like something speaking just out of understanding.

He walked for hours in that place. The forest changed subtly the deeper he went — the shapes lost structure, the patterns broke. Things emerged: stalks with twitching tips, gaps that breathed, openings that pulsed closed just before he could pass through. The ground grew soft beneath his feet, then brittle, then soft again. The only constant was the hum — now behind him, now beneath him, now inside his ribs.

And always, something followed.

He never turned. Never ran. Just walked, faster and faster, heart hammering, bones ringing louder with each step until the hum drowned out thought.

He woke gasping, nails dug into his palms. Kael’s hand was on his shoulder. Neither spoke.

<br/><br/>
Outside, the tunnel walls pulsed with dim warmth, a deep orange glow that faded quickly. 

It hadn’t done that before.

It never did again.

Kael began to change after that.

Not visibly. Not yet. But he no longer flinched when the vents howled or the lights dimmed. 

He began walking ahead of the group, sometimes vanishing for hours and returning with roots no one had seen growing. Once, he brought back water in a crystal shard that refilled itself twice before going dry.

He didn’t say how he found it. He just smiled — the same broken smile as always — and handed it to Lio.

“We’ll need it tomorrow,” was all he said.

Lio didn’t ask.

<br/><br/>
They lost another six before they found the first chamber.

It opened without warning — the tunnel simply widened, as if the path had grown tired of narrowness. The ceiling arched high and faceted like a cathedral roof, with vines of dull metal threading between geometric outcroppings. 

The floor was warm. The walls breathed.

They set up camp. Sayren called it a place of echo. He said the underworld had many. That it remembered those who passed through.

Some said prayers. Some lit offerings of bitter smoke, unsure whether to raise them to the sky they had left or to whatever breathed below.

Orira did not pray. She took out a fragment of Skyglass wrapped in cloth, cracked but intact, and placed it at the chamber’s center. “So we remember,” she said.

Kael sat close to it that night. He hummed to it. Lio thought he heard the hum answered — but when he looked, Kael was already asleep.

<br/><br/>
That night, Lio dreamed of Nia.

Not as she was when she died, but before — in Auvira’s Crest, laughing in the ivy, tossing him the reedball again and again. In the dream, it never fell. The sky didn’t burn. The dome held. And she looked at him — not with sorrow, but with apology.

He woke with tears on his face.

<br/><br/>
Kael was already awake, standing next to him, watching the far wall.

Then the chamber shifted. A low sound — deep, slow, and not of stone or air. Something below them exhaled, and for a heartbeat the walls flushed with faint light — not enough to see, but enough to feel. The warmth pulsed once through the stone and vanished.

A silence followed — not absence, but stillness. Expectant. A boundary passed.

Lio sat upright, breath caught.

Kael didn’t look at him when he spoke.

“There’s no going back,” he said.

And Lio knew he was right.
