> “Memory becomes myth. Myth becomes fuel.”

In the Deep, stories do not simply entertain — they shape culture, justify belief, and feed shrines. Mythic characters are those whose lives (or deaths) marked turning points in Kynari history. Their names echo across Cycles, their actions misremembered and ritualized, their Ky preserved, stolen, or fought over.

Some lived. Some still live. Some may never have existed — but their influence is real.

## Index of Figures

Below is a growing list of mythic individuals whose actions, sacrifices, or transformations shaped the world as it exists in Cycle 3.4.

| Name | Title | Known For |
|------|-------|-----------|
| [Lio](/wiki/mythic-characters/lio/) | The Founder | A child survivor of the Shattering of Skyglass. His descent through the Maw marked the beginning of the exile. Seen as a reluctant icon by many, and a vessel of fate by others. |
| [Kael](/wiki/mythic-characters/kael/) | The Quiet Fire | Lio’s companion in the descent. Burn-scarred, dream-touched, and changed by the Maw. Origins of many survival rites trace to him. |
| [White Ash](/wiki/mythic-characters/white-ash/) | The Hollow Walker | A Ky-rich scavenger who took a forbidden crystal and lived. Became the first known Hollow to walk without collapse. A cautionary ghost. |
| [The Emberchild](/wiki/mythic-characters/emberchild/) | Solar-Born | Said to carry a memory of the sun in their blood. Hunted by the Conclave and idolized by Loyalists. May be a Ky echo given flesh. |
| [The Candled Son](/wiki/mythic-characters/candled-son/) | Mirrored Prophet | Speaks only in reversed phrases. Born during a Pulsestorm. Seen by Shrinekeepers as a vessel for dual divine memory. |

## Truth and Legend

Each of these figures has multiple interpretations depending on faction, shrine, and bloodline. The Core Faithful may see Lio as a misguided flame-chaser; the Shrinekeepers may venerate White Ash not as failure, but as a lesson incarnate.

Character entries may include:
- Known historical accounts (if any)
- Cultural variations and contradictions
- Surviving relics or Ky fragments
- Places of worship or disputed memory

## Ongoing Record

The mythic record is always incomplete. More characters may be discovered, remembered, or reinterpreted as new shrines are unearthed and old truths collapse. Some entries may be fragmentary, and others deliberately altered by faction interests.
