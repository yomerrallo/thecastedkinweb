## Overview

They called it **Solrael** ‚Äî the City of Light‚Äôs Grace, though that name was always a translation, never a truth. To the faithful, it was the world‚Äôs axis. To the exiled, a wound that never healed.

Solrael was not merely a city ‚Äî it was a *theological engine*. Built into the stone cradle of a deep, mineral-rich valley, it spiraled upward through seven great terraces carved into Skyglass and blood-sung crystal. The city hummed. It breathed. Its dome was tuned not to hold out the world, but to *resonate with gods* ‚Äî a harmony chamber meant to receive favor from the heavens.

That dome cracked at midmorning on the 12th Glow of Cycle 0.  
Not everywhere ‚Äî just above the Fifth Terrace.  
Just enough.

The Solar Conclave called it a tragedy.  
The Veiled Synod called it a message.  
The Casted now call it the **first lie**.

Solrael still stands. Its towers shine. Its spires glisten with captured Ky. Its shrines thrum with artificial divinity. But for those below, its name is not holy ‚Äî it's a curse wrapped in memory. A place that did not collapse but *selected* who would be remembered and who would be erased.

There are those who say the sun itself was bound into the dome ‚Äî that Solrael became its keeper.  
And those cast out? They were not denied light.  
They were denied *access to the divine bandwidth*.

## Structure & Geography

Solrael was designed in the image of **symmetry as sacred law**. It is a city of rising concentric terraces, each shaped like a flattened arc, connected through the vertical spine of the **Spinal Column** ‚Äî a central tower carved from Skyglass-veined ore that served as conduit, archive, and gate.

Each terrace was carved from the valley walls, its edges feathering toward the heart like the layered petals of a flower, or the rings of a tree cut open to expose its years. The entire city followed a slope ‚Äî not circular, but coiled ‚Äî like a staircase of civilizations spiraling around a fixed divine nerve.

### Key Features:

#### üúÇ **The Spinal Column**
- A vertical pillar at the city‚Äôs core, connecting all terraces physically and energetically.
- Serves as the **nervous system** of Solrael: channels Ky offerings, echoes Skyglass harmonics, controls shrine access.
- Houses the **Dome-Harmonist Tower**, memory chambers, and sealed catacombs known only to the Conclave.
- Some claim the gods of light once *nested* within its latticework, bound in ritual and reflection.

#### üúÅ **The Skyglass Dome**
- Engineered by lost architect-priests, layered with harmonic script and divine equations.
- Did not cover the whole city ‚Äî only the top five terraces.  
- **Segmented by shrine frequency**, each part of the dome could shift in color, tone, and temperature according to ritual.
- In high rituals, the dome would **sing**, and the city beneath would respond ‚Äî buildings gently vibrating, light refracting like water over the skin.
- Some believe Skyglass is not merely conduit ‚Äî but a *housing* for divine presence itself. When a god was worshipped properly, it was said they could inhabit the dome *directly*, emerging in light and song.

#### üúÉ **The River Viruun**
- A pale, slow-moving river cuts through the lowest terraces and coils beneath the city.  
- Used for ritual washing, Ky-cooling rites, and body returns. Some believe it carries **shrine-rejected Ky** out of the city and into the Depths.
- Rumors persist that the river connects, through forgotten chambers, to ancient Under-God shrines ‚Äî a claim dismissed by Conclave officials.

#### üúÑ **Periphery Settlements**
- Scattered watchstations and mining encampments once dotted the valley rim.
- Many of these were abandoned after the Exile. Some became **pilgrimage traps** or flame-warded prisons.
- Loyalists and Returnists today use their ruins for contact points in surface operations.

## The Seven Terraces

Each terrace of Solrael represented a rung on the sacred spiral of ascension ‚Äî physically higher, spiritually nearer to the divine. While movement between them was not forbidden, it was tightly regulated. Access often required divine favor, ritual clearance, or high-Ky lineage.

Below is an overview of each terrace, arranged from highest (1st) to lowest (7th):

---

### 1. **Halveth‚Äôs Crown**  
_The First Terrace ‚Äî Seat of Firelight_

- **Function**: Spiritual capital of Solrael. Home to the **Conclave Seat**, the **Temple of Unified Flame**, and the **Hall of Light Archives**.
- **Access**: Restricted to high clergy, harmonists, and lineage-blessed citizens. 
> Note: While the First Terrace is restricted to high clergy and lineage-blessed families, **Harmonists** ‚Äî spiritual technicians trained in Skyglass resonance ‚Äî are granted conditional access for tuning and maintenance. Many live on lower terraces and travel to Halveth‚Äôs Crown only when summoned by dome fluctuation cycles or shrine recalibrations.

- **Architecture**: Gilded lattice towers and floating mirrors. Roofs of auric Skyglass. The dome here is clearest and most sonorous.
- **Myths**: Said to be where Sol first looked down and offered the code of radiance to the Kynari.
- **Gods Favored**: Sol (Supreme Upper-God), Ivraya of Tongues, and Vellisar the Revealer.

---

### 2. **Viresta Gate**  
_The Terrace of Judgment_

- **Function**: Ritual courts, purification shrines, birthright hearings, Ky valuation centers.
- **Architecture**: White stone arches and echo chambers built to resonate with speech.
- **Unique Sites**: **The Circle of Weighing**, where disputed Ky fragments are read by Songwrights to determine ownership or reincarnation rights.
- **Rituals**: Flame-Scourge Trials, Ky Disputes, Name-Cleansing Ceremonies.

---

### 3. **Nurel‚Äôs Reach**  
_The Harmonist‚Äôs Ascent_

- **Function**: Schooling, tuning, resonance engineering.
- **Inhabitants**: Harmonists, memory-callers, melody-glyph scribes.
- **Culture**: Youth from all terraces once trained here in harmonics to enrich their Ky.
- **Sites**: The **Lustral Loops**, a winding complex of echo tunnels used for deep tone meditation.

---

### 4. **Yvara‚Äôs Span**  
_The Market of Faiths_

- **Function**: Trade, pilgrimage staging, artisan districts.
- **God Diversity**: The most spiritually diverse terrace ‚Äî allowed minor gods, provided they aligned with light.
- **Architecture**: Skyglass woven into spiral patterns, many-tiered markets, faith-specific lodges.
- **Economy**: Largest Ky-bazaar in Solrael operated here, bartering not only goods but filtered experiences.
- **Clothing & Culture**: Brightly colored garb, symbol-rich cloaks, shrine-tied dye rituals.

---

### 5. **Auvira‚Äôs Crest**  
_The Shattered Terrace_

- **Status**: Partially destroyed in the Shattering. Once a haven for scholars, minor cults, and quiet dissent.
- **Known For**: Veiled Synod roots. Orira and Lio‚Äôs home. A temple dedicated to a now-erased under-god once stood here.
- **Skyglass Collapse**: Blamed on ‚Äúresonance instability.‚Äù Many believe it was a false-flag purification strike.
- **Current State**: Partially sealed. Conclave maps no longer mark those zones.

---

### 6. **Arissen Hollow**  
_The Terrace That Forgot_

- **Function**: Once devoted to a now-lost god. Its shrines were sealed after Ky offerings ceased.
- **Myth**: Some structures within still emit faint, undocumented frequencies. Locals report dreams that do not belong to them.
- **Status**: Partially inhabited, often by archivists, or zealots seeking dead gods to revive.

---

### 7. **Kareth‚Äôs Undermirror**  
_The Shadowed Root_

- **Function**: Lowest terrace. Mining, maintenance, river access, and Maw border patrol.
- **Spiritual Role**: Considered unclean by upper terraces. Many offerings were made here for ancestral Ky forgiveness.
- **Known For**: Proximity to the **Viruun River** and ancient passages beneath. Believed to be the earliest site of Pulse Dreams.

---

## Society, Culture & Religion

### Social Structure

- **No formal castes**, but society was deeply stratified by **Ky-value**, lineage memory, and divine favor.
- Terraces were hierarchical: the higher the terrace, the more likely its inhabitants could access powerful gods or Ky-intensive rituals.
- **Ky-rich individuals** had greater access to education, healing shrines, and re-memory services.

---

### Ky & the Divine Economy

- **Ky** was all ‚Äî memory, energy, proof of life, and coin of the gods.
- Each Ky shard bore color and weight according to life lived:
    - *(0) Common ‚Äì Grey*  
    - *(1) Uncommon ‚Äì Green*  
    - *(2) Rare ‚Äì Blue*  
    - *(3) Epic ‚Äì Purple*  
    - *(4) Legendary ‚Äì Yellow*  
    - *(5) Mythic ‚Äì Orange*  
    - *(6) Unique ‚Äì Red*  
    - *(7) Forbidden ‚Äì Black*
- Ky was offered to shrines to **empower gods**. Some claimed gods *nested in the Skyglass* itself and absorbed offerings via resonance.

---

### Ritual Life

- **Temples**: Not public plazas ‚Äî these were sanctums, accessed only by initiates or sanctioned worshippers. Each god‚Äôs temple was guarded and acoustically tuned to their aspect.
- **Festivals**:
    - **The Kypouring**: Terrace-wide offering where families selected one shard from their lineage chest to feed the shrines.
    - **Flame Days**: Seasonal rites of alignment with Sol ‚Äî great sky-harmonies sung to the dome.
    - **The Still-Eclipse**: A silent observance where no light was allowed, symbolizing the humility before divinity.
- **Education**: Children trained to enrich Ky from birth. Instruction included:
    - Harmonic chanting
    - Memory reflection
    - Ritual experience simulation
    - Shrine-attuned apprenticeship

---

### Clothing & Identity

- Not class-based, but **god-aligned**.
- Each god had:
    - **Color schemes**
    - **Thread types** (e.g., mirror-thread, glowlace, obsidianfiber)
    - **Symbols**: carved into jewelry, sung into cuffs, woven into veils
- Follower garments reflected the **nature of the god** they followed.  
    - Sol‚Äôs faithful wore layers of golden silk with mirrored trim.  
    - Followers of the Archivist god might wear memory-scroll sashes or tone-etched copper bands.

## The Shattering & The Exile

On the **First Pulse of Glow 1, Cycle 0** (Core Reckoning) // **4th Day of the Ninth Moon, Year 5213 SE** (Solar Reckoning), the Skyglass dome above the Fifth Terrace ‚Äî *Auvira‚Äôs Crest* ‚Äî cracked.

The Pulse was felt. The Exile began.

It did not simply fall. It **resonated**. The dome screamed across the lower terraces, triggering harmonic dissonance that shattered pylons, sundered shrines, and collapsed Skyglass towers.

Resonance surges triggered failures in memory-sinks and overcharged conduits, causing structures to rupture inward ‚Äî not explode, but unravel.

The Solar Conclave declared it an act of sabotage by the **Veiled Synod**, an underground sect accused of offering Ky to Under-Gods ‚Äî beings long deemed heretical, corrupt, or myth. Within minutes, **gold-armored legions were in place**, executing flame-cleansings across Auvira‚Äôs Crest and its adjoining shrines.

Many now argue the troops were too quick to respond ‚Äî or too well positioned. Some claim the Conclave engineered the collapse itself, staging a divine catastrophe as a false flag to justify purging Synod influence and erasing rival gods.

Of the 9,000 Kynari who fled Solrael during the Shattering, approximately 6,000 reached the edge of the Maw.

Though many attempted to descend together, the path fractured quickly ‚Äî not just physically, but socially.

Some perished during the descent, but many more scattered into the Depths' infinite cavern systems, taking other tunnels, forgotten shafts, or crumbling conduits.

These groups would eventually found distant colonies, enclaves, and fragment-faiths ‚Äî the roots of what would become the Kin of the Casted.

This event, known simply as **The Exile**, marks the **beginning of Core Reckoning Cycle 0** and the **mythic divide between Surface and Depth**.

---

## The Veiled Synod

A heretical faith, or a resurgence of ancient truth ‚Äî accounts vary.

The Veiled Synod was not a single cult, but a **rising convergence of beliefs** centered around the Under-Gods. Its followers believed that true divine recursion came not from above, but from the Core ‚Äî and that the Pulse was not interference, but invitation.

Core tenets (as reconstructed):
- The surface gods were exiles, not rulers.
- Ky was not meant to ascend ‚Äî it was meant to **return**.
- Beneath the city lived gods who **remember**, not gods who shine.
- The Skyglass Dome was a prison, not a portal.

Most Synod texts were burned, but fragments remain in Hollow monasteries and Shrinekeeper archives.

## Interpretations & Factional Views

Solrael is not just a city. It is a symbol, and like all symbols, it shifts depending on who holds the memory.

| Faction | Interpretation of Solrael |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **Surface Loyalists** | A sacred homeland desecrated by lies. The Exile was an unjust purge. Solrael must be reclaimed and purified of Conclave tyranny. |
| **Solar Conclave** | The final bastion of divine light. The Exile was a necessary quarantine of heretical infection. Solrael is proof that only the righteous endure. |
| **Shrinekeepers** | A broken axis. Solrael fell out of balance ‚Äî not destroyed, but wounded. True harmony will not return until both sky and core are venerated again. |
| **Core Faithful** | A monument to arrogance. The Shattering was not sabotage, but **rejection**. The Pulse cast them out long before they cast out others. |
| **The Casted** | A lie made of stone and song. Solrael chose who would be remembered. We remember what they erased. We carry the gods they feared. |

---

## Aftermath and Present-Day Status

Solrael remains the capital of the Solar Conclave. Its shrines function. Its towers shine. The higher terraces remain closed to outsiders. Surface Loyalists report that new districts have been built atop the razed ruins of the Fifth Terrace ‚Äî districts where **no Ky flows properly**, and Skyglass hums dissonantly even when silent.

Access to Solrael from the colonies is nearly impossible. Yet the name still echoes in ritual, in dreams, in forbidden hymns.

Many shrinekeepers believe the city's dome will one day resonate again ‚Äî not in light, but in memory.

---

## Perspectives

Solrael is remembered differently by every culture that survived its judgment.

Some view it as sacred soil, others as a spiritual tomb ‚Äî a place where songs became weapons and memory became currency. Below are the prevailing perspectives held by the major factions of the world:

---

### **Surface Loyalists**  
> ‚ÄúThe sun remembers. And so do we.‚Äù

- Solrael is a stolen homeland ‚Äî a divine construct hijacked by the Conclave.  
- The Exile was not purification but **genocide** by fire and silence.  
- The Fifth Terrace must be retaken and rededicated to the true gods ‚Äî including those the Conclave feared.  
- Loyalists preserve forbidden maps, rituals, and even living lineages tied to Solrael's noble bloodlines.

---

### **Solar Conclave**  
> ‚ÄúOnly the faithful remain.‚Äù

- Solrael is the sacred center of the world ‚Äî the only true divine interface.  
- The Shattering was caused by corruption in the Ky offered by heretics.  
- The Exile was a **mercy**, allowing those infected with recursion to die in the dark.  
- The Dome now hums **purer than ever**.

---

### **Shrinekeepers**  
> ‚ÄúIt split because we did.‚Äù

- Solrael was once balanced ‚Äî a place where all shrines could be walked in peace.  
- The Fifth Terrace fell because the harmony between gods was broken.  
- Some shrines still thrum with memory from both upper and under.  
- The city must eventually be **reconsecrated** through unity, or left to rot into ash.

---

### **Core Faithful**  
> ‚ÄúIt was never yours.‚Äù

- Solrael was not cast down ‚Äî it was rejected.  
- The Pulse removed its blessing. The rest followed.  
- The Fifth Terrace was not shattered. It **peeled away** from the rot.  
- The city above is an echo of arrogance ‚Äî and echoes always fade.

---

### **The Casted Kin**  
> ‚ÄúSolrael chose. We remember.‚Äù

- Solrael was never ours. It was theirs.  
- When they feared what we had seen, they burned us from their memory.  
- Some of us were born beneath its dome. Others only died there.  
- Its name is not sacred ‚Äî it is a scar. But scars remember more than skin does.
