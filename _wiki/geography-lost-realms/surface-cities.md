## Overview

Before the Exile, the surface of the world was home to many Kynari settlements, spiritual nexuses, and Skyglass constructions. Solrael is the only city remembered in full — the last known functioning capital under the Upper-Gods — but it was not alone. Pilgrim-chants, forgotten ledgers, and fragment-Ky recordings speak of **ruined spires**, **vanished cities**, and **regions where shrines still echo, though no voice dares call them home**.

Modern scholars in the Depths classify these as the **Lost Above** — a collective term for all surface sites **outside Solrael** that have fallen into ruin, myth, or active denial by the Conclave.

## Surface Status Post-Exile

- **Solrael remains occupied**, controlled by the Solar Conclave, and cut off from the Casted.
- **No other known surface city functions** in full, but:
  - **Ruins are suspected** beyond the Solar Shell Ranges and the Dustline Flats.
  - **Pilgrim legends** speak of towers that move, cities that sank, and gods that "unbuilt" their own temples.
- Surface travel is perilous and restricted.
  - **Loyalist spies** claim to have visited the remnants of outer sanctums.
  - Some colonies in the Depths revere **ruins they’ve never seen**, basing whole rites on surface shadows.

## Confirmed or Mythic Surface Cities

### 🌆 **Solrael**  
- **Status**: Active, occupied by the Conclave.  
- **Role**: Spiritual and political capital; seat of the Solar Conclave and the Temple of Unified Flame.  
- **Notes**: Site of the Skyglass Dome, the Shattering, and the Maw. Detailed in [Solrael](/thecastedkinweb/wiki/geography-lost-realms/solrael/).

### 🏚️ **Nathira, the Spires of Smoke**  
- **Status**: Ruined or vanished.  
- **Lore**: Once a cliffside city of sky-altars and echo-steeples. Said to have vanished in a single Pulse, leaving behind only its shadow burned into nearby stone.  
- **Gods Worshipped**: Tirith the Withheld, Elariin the Open-Handed (both nearly forgotten).  
- **Current Belief**: Some claim Nathira is still “visible” during certain solar alignments. No one who seeks it ever returns.

---

### 🪞 **The Hollowed Vaults of Myrr**  
- **Status**: Unknown / Forbidden.  
- **Lore**: Referred to in Conclave banlists as a site of recursion error and divine interference. Legends describe it as a city built **beneath** itself, constantly replacing its upper levels.  
- **Possible Location**: Somewhere beyond the Sunflare Expanse. All maps that include Myrr eventually erase themselves or burn.  
- **Current Belief**: Shrinekeepers deny its existence. Returnists speak of Myrr as a **key to inversion**, where the Pulse once echoed on the surface.

## Why the Casted Never Fled There

> "We did not flee Solrael for want of cities.  
> We fled because no city would take us."  
> — High Warden of the Third Cycle, Cycle 1.8

- The **Maw was the only descent remembered** in the chaos of the Shattering.  
- The Conclave **locked down all known outbound paths**. Soldiers pursued the fleeing through every viable corridor.  
- Ruins like Nathira were considered **cursed, uninhabitable, or unreachable**.
- Some say the gods **closed all other roads**, forcing the Casted downward — either as punishment or design.
