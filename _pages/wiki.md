Welcome to the living archive of **The Casted Kin**, where exile carved a people and memory shapes the world. The entries below are organized into sections, each rooted in fact, belief, or reconstruction. As with all things in the Depths — trust, but verify.

This wiki follows a principle of **multi-perspective neutrality**: entries reflect fractured truths as told by colonists, the Conclave, pilgrims, and those in between.

---

## Colonies & Regions  
The settlements, god-aligned politics, lineage dynamics, and Ky-driven economies of post-Exile life.

---

## Creatures, Flora, Fauna  
The living world beneath and beyond logic — from Depth-walkers to shrine-feeding parasites.

---

## Factions & Faiths  
The powers that shape belief — or weaponize it.  
- [Core Faithful](/thecastedkinweb/wiki/factions-faiths/core-faithful/)
