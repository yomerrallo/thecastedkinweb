Welcome to **The World Codex** for The Casted Kin — a living archive of lore, setting, and myth. Here you’ll find the collected knowledge, stories, and perspectives that shape the world. This codex is organized into sections, each reflecting the fractured truths and beliefs of its people.

This Codex is designed for players, readers, and creators to explore the world’s history, cultures, and mysteries. Entries reflect multiple perspectives: colonists, the Conclave, pilgrims, and more.
