> — Shrinekeeper Orira, Cycle 4.2

In the Depths, worship is not a matter of faith — it is **transactional**, **ritualistic**, and often **desperate**. Gods **do not grant favor freely**. They demand **memory**, **essence**, and **pain** in return.

Shrines act as the **interface** between Kin and god — but the outcome depends on what is given.

### Forms of Offering

| Type         | Description | Typical Reactions |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Ky**       | Crystallized memory — the purest and most accepted form of offering. | Most gods accept Ky, especially shards aligned with their nature. |
| **Kynari**  | A lesser being or Hollow — sacrificed in the god’s name. | Seen as crude but effective by militant or cruel gods. Forbidden by Sol. |
| **Relic**    | A memory-bound artifact or echo-object. | Some gods hoard these; others destroy them to claim the story. |
| **Memory**   | A personal memory willingly surrendered. | Rare ritual; only certain shrines allow it. May alter player stats or past. |

---

### Shrine Behavior

Shrines are **not static altars** — they adapt, react, and even evolve depending on:

- The **god's current influence**
- The **biome** or **colony context**
- The **player’s karma** or past offerings

Some shrines **lock out** the player for past offenses. Others **change shape**, offer **unique interactions**, or go **dark** without explanation.

---

### Worship Mechanics

- **Gods track loyalty.**  
  Consistent offerings and aligned choices increase favor. Switching allegiances can trigger shrine rejection or divine retaliation.

- **Gods remember what you gave.**  
  Offerings leave **resonance trails** — permanent marks in Ky memory, even if a player tries to hide their actions.

- **Some gods lie.**  
  Not all divine interactions are trustworthy. Certain shrines may distort memories, fake miracles, or rewrite offerings.

---

### Divine Currency

All offerings are converted into **Ky-flow**, which is absorbed into nearby **shrine conduits** and then carried through the **Rootglass Veins** toward the god’s unseen realm.

> Gods do not metabolize Ky — they remember through it.

Each god **feeds differently**, and not strictly along domain lines:

- Some crave **purity** or **clarity** — seeking unbroken memory shards and untainted devotion.
- Others hunger for **violence**, **passion**, or **betrayal** — memories that burn rather than illuminate.
- A few prefer **strange echoes** — forgotten words, relics, or fractured dreams.

These preferences depend on a mix of divine traits:

| Trait         | Influence on Offerings |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Domain**     | May affect shrine structure and offering types, but not desires. |
| **Era**        | Older gods may reject modern rituals or require ancient ones. |
| **Personality**| Dictates how a god interprets an offering — merciful vs. hateful, etc. |
| **Biome**      | Gods tied to rare or harsh environments may prefer unusual offerings. |
| **Origin Lore**| A god’s backstory shapes their hunger — e.g. a betrayed god may value sacrifice over faith. |

Even within a single pantheon, gods may **compete** for Ky, twisting shrines and demands to outshine rivals.  
Some will even **feign alliance** — until the memory burns wrong.
