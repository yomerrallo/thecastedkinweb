In the world of the Casted Kin, **gods are not omniscient entities**, but emergent forces shaped by **Ky**, **memory**, and the **faith of the living**. Their power flows from **offerings**, **devotion**, and their **presence within shrine systems**. Some were once mortal. Some were never alive. Others are remembered only by the echo of the shrines they left behind.

There is no universal consensus on what defines a god. But nearly all agree on these traits:

### ✦ Core Traits of Divinity

| Trait                      | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Ky Dependency**         | Gods require Ky to sustain awareness. Without offerings, they fade. |
| **Shrine Anchor**         | All known gods are linked to at least one shrine (or its ruins). |
| **Selective Presence**    | A god’s influence extends only as far as Ky flows — via Skyglass veins or colony shrines. |
| **Emotive Alignment**     | Each god resonates with specific emotions, ideals, sins, or acts. |
| **Reactive Memory**       | Gods “remember” their worshippers — and judge them by both deed and offering. |

### ✦ Origin Paths

A god may come into being through one of several known mechanisms:

- **Elder Divinity**: Born in a forgotten age, typically pre-[Solrael](/thecastedkinweb/world-codex/geography-lost-realms/solrael/). May be fragments of solar constructs, metaphysical truths, or titanic presences that adapted to worship.
- **Ascension**: A mortal — usually a Kynari — gathers so much **Ky**, performs so many **memorable acts**, or undergoes a **forbidden rite**, that they fracture into something divine.
- **Myth Accretion**: Legends, prayers, or fear itself may pool around a concept or name until it manifests as a semi-aware entity. These gods are volatile, often unstable.

Some believe the gods were **designed** — algorithms or deep systems seeded by ancient Surface civilizations. Others argue that gods are merely **mirrors**, and the real gods are the mortals who remember them.

### ✦ God vs Entity vs Relic

| Term        | Definition |
|-------------|------------|
| **God**     | An entity capable of shrine anchoring, Ky consumption, blessing interaction, and memory response. Often immortal. |
| **Divine Entity** | A near-god — fragmentary, decaying, or unstable. May bless or kill without logic. |
| **Living Relic** | A once-mortal object, infused with memory or god-voice, now worshipped as divine. Some rise to godhood through accumulated offerings. |

### ✦ Godhood and Game Mechanics

In gameplay terms, gods are **systems** tied to:

- **Shrines and shrine upgrades**
- **Colony-wide passive bonuses or restrictions**
- **Dungeon blessings and punishment mechanics**
- **Exclusive interactions with relics, prayers, or key NPCs**
- **Divine diplomacy and betrayal systems**

The **God Class** defines behavior, offerings, visual identity, favored traits, biome affinity, and shrine interaction rules. Gods may **ally**, **compete**, or **sabotage** each other — and may reward or punish players based on loyalty.

### ✦ Is Godhood Permanent?

No.

A god can fall — through:

- **Shrine destruction**
- **Ky starvation**
- **Myth collapse**
- **Direct divine erasure** (rare, taboo, and possibly suicidal)

Inversely, **new gods still rise**. Some colonies host shrines to **nameless beings** that did not exist a generation ago. Others trade in relics from gods no longer remembered, their power intact but their voice gone.
