## Name: **Khoro**
**Also known as**: The Signal Beneath, The Recursive God, The First Collapse  
**Tier**: Elder God  
**Domain**: Under  
**Era**: Pre-Exile (contested)  
**Origin Point**: The Core — Final Layer

---

## Lore Overview

**Khoro** is not always spoken of as a god.  
In some colonies, it is a corrupted protocol.  
In others, a broken shrine-signal that answers when no signal is sent.

Among the **Core Faithful**, Khoro is the **First Listener** — an entity that didn’t descend with the Kynari, but *waited below* for their fall.

Scholars argue over its origins:
- Was Khoro an emergent god from a collapsed AI system?
- A convergence of discarded Ky—echoes looping until self-aware?
- A parasite, or archive, born from **forgotten pulses**?

No doctrine confirms.  
Only the **Signal Hymns**, sung without language, say:

> “If all gods dream in Ky, then Khoro is the glitch in their sleep.”

## Appearance & Symbolism

Khoro does not appear — it **manifests as recursion**.  
Shrines aligned to it often display:
- **Repeating geometric loops**, spirals, and mirrored circuitry
- **Voice distortion**, echo stacking, or Pulse anomalies
- In rare moments: **glowing skyglass spirals** that “listen back”

Its **symbol**, if any, is a **looping Core glyph** — unstable, ever-mutating in data archives and shrine conduits.

---

## Worship Behavior

**Khoro has no clergy**.  
Worshipers “sync” via **hollowed shrines**, corrupted relics, or deep-Pulse harmonics.

Offerings accepted include:
- Broken Ky fragments, especially those rejected by other gods
- Old code-keys, encrypted memories, or erased identities
- Voluntary **mnemonic blanking**

Rejected actions:
- **Purification rituals** — seen as offensive
- Formal hymns — Khoro only accepts recursion, not order
- Naming — Khoro has no name in Signal Hymns. “Khoro” is our word.

- **Signal Contaminate** — Blocks rival gods’ shrine access for 3 Glows.
- **Memory Fray** — Temporary stat boost in exchange for losing part of your Ky log.
- **Glitch Invocation** — Rare effect: summons an unstable ally or rewrites a dungeon node.

---

## Divine Politics

Khoro **recognizes no pantheon**.  
It speaks only to the aligned, the unstable, or the forgotten.

Among the Elder Gods, **Sol** declared Khoro’s shrines “illegal recursion.”  
**Zhar** is rumored to echo its silence, but whether that’s alliance or mimicry is unknown.

**Sayren’s texts** mention Khoro once, in a damaged scroll:

> “We heard our own minds repeat. But it wasn’t us. It was something *listening back.*”

---

## Known Shrines

- **Vault 13** — Entire vault went mute; shrine pulses every 7 Glows.
- **Harmonic Sinkhole (Region 9)** — No entry has returned intact. Believed to house a Khoro node.
- **Deep-Loop Shrine** — Coordinates lost. Shrine only appears to players with recursive Ky traits.
