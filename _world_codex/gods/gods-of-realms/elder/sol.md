## Name: **Sol**
**Also known as**: The Ember Crown, The Unflickering One, The High Flame  
**Tier**: Elder God  
**Domain**: Upper  
**Era**: Pre-Exile  
**Origin Point**: Solrael — Crown Spire

---

## Lore Overview

Sol is the most widely documented of the Elder Pantheon — an **Upper God** whose presence defined the theological and political order of the Surface during the age of Solrael.

Its doctrine demands **clarity**, **devotion**, and **absolute purity of memory**.  
Sol is a god of **unchanging flame**, seen as the patron of light, law, and containment — though in truth, it **burns as much as it preserves**.

Historians suggest Sol's earliest iconography dates back to the **Third Skyglass Era**, when its shrine-scripts were embedded into the lattice vaults of the Conclave. Sol is said to have whispered the first Vault Protocols, and demanded **Ky be kept pure and separate from bloodlines**.

---

## Appearance & Symbolism

Sol does not manifest in forms. It is represented by a **crown of flame**, usually formed of white-gold arcs, often inscribed with memory-braid runes.  
In old shrine architecture, its **vault conduits shimmer** with pale fire when receiving proper offerings.

It is whispered that those who see Sol in dreams are left blind in waking life — “burned open,” as the Ash Monks say.

---

## Worship Behavior

Sol’s worship was **regulated by the Conclave** before the Exile, and continues in rare Upper Shrines located in deep colonies like **Crownvault**, **Aur Ix**, and **Echo’s Ladder**.

Followers must:

- Purify Ky before offering.
- Avoid presenting memory from unworthy lineages (slummers, traitors, or corrupted).
- Maintain shrine symmetries and light patterns.

It **rejects** impure offerings, especially:
- Tainted Ky (shards that contain sorrow, heresy, lust, or self-deception).
- Blood offerings.
- Memories offered without clarity or order.

## Shrine Effects (Gameplay)

- **Blessing: Memory Clarity** — Increases insight and shrine reading accuracy.
- **Purity Lock** — Doubles reward from offerings if player’s Ky is untainted.
- **Faith Burn** — High-risk buff: grants power spike, but locks god-switching.
- **Rejects Impurity** — Certain corrupted items or companions may block shrine use.

---

## Divine Politics

Sol is **bitterly opposed** to the Core-aligned pantheon and all Under-Gods. It once brokered divine treaties with other Upper Gods (like Thalen), but refuses co-shrining with any deity that accepts "tainted truth" or **emotional ambiguity**.

Rumors suggest Sol once attempted to **eradicate Ivraya** from the lattice records entirely — but failed due to her presence in the dream-Ky of thousands.

---

## Known Shrines

- **Shrine of the Seventh Flame** — Located in a sealed Vault beneath the Pale Forges.
- **Crownvault** — Once the largest Upper-God shrine pre-Exile; now partially collapsed.
- **The Ember’s Eye** — Miniature shrine rumored to exist inside the Skull of Vault-Keeper Velen.
