**Also known as**: The Maw Below, The Hungering One, Mouth That Remembers Nothing

## Lore Overview

Zhar is one of the oldest known Under-Gods — a being not of thought or word, but of absence. Where others crave worship or remembrance, Zhar is a **god of forgetting**. Its followers claim it does not bless, speak, or answer. It **unmakes**.

Ancient inscriptions recovered from collapsed Maw shrines suggest Zhar was once revered — or feared — long before the founding of Solrael. Unlike most gods, Zhar feeds not on memory but on **its erasure**.

Some Core harmonics claim Zhar is the shadow of language itself — that its shrines vibrate with **anti-memory**, and that prolonged exposure can dissolve even ancestral Ky.

---

## Appearance & Symbolism

Zhar is never depicted directly. Instead, its shrines feature a **jagged black ring** of void-glass, or mouth-like circular carvings that **lack names, faces, or prayers**.

When approached, these shrines generate **zones of mute pressure** — a dull ache behind the ears, and a numbing of personal memory. Some describe it as the silence between Pulses.

---

## Worship Behavior

Zhar’s shrines are almost entirely forbidden. In known cycles, only a handful survive — often in the deepest hollowgrounds or fungal vaults beneath Region 7.

Worshipers must:

- Offer **unspoken sacrifice** — blood or memory must be given in complete silence.
- Avoid writing, song, or verbal invocation during approach.
- Abstain from naming Zhar directly — even in thought.

It **rejects**:

- All hymn-based offerings.
- Purified or clear Ky (white, amber, or bright-hued shards).
- Any connection to Upper-God alignments.

- **Faith Blackout** — Nearby shrines of non-Under Gods lose function temporarily.

## Divine Politics

Zhar is **loathed** by the Upper Pantheon and most Core harmonists. Only a few radical Returnist sects have attempted to integrate Zharic rites — usually ending in madness or silence cult schisms.

Some scholars believe Zhar is not one god, but the **lingering will** of forgotten ones — that its hunger is not divine, but **remedial**, healing the world by erasing its memory-scars.

## Known Shrines

- **The Vault Maw** — Located beneath a sealed descent tunnel near Region 8; off-limits to all Conclave scouts.
- **Shrine of the Last Mouth** — Lost during the Hollow Rebellion, but fragments echo pulses in fungal veins.
- **Veil Pit 9** — A rumored hidden shrine in the Dream-Veins; only visible to those who’ve forgotten their own name.
