## Elder Gods

These are ancient entities — born before the Exile or shaped during the collapse. Most do not speak in mortal terms.

| Name         | Title              | Domain | Era        | Worship Traits |
|--------------|--------------------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Sol**      | The Ember Crown    | Upper  | Pre-Exile  | Demands purity, rejects heresy |
| **Zhar**     | The Maw Below      | Under  | Pre-Exile  | Hungers for silence and blood |
| *(Add more)* |                    |        |            |                |

## Ascended Gods

Once mortal — Kynari or otherwise — these beings accumulated or were infused with enough Ky to transcend.

| Name         | Title                 | Origin | Era        | Worship Traits |
|--------------|-----------------------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Ivraya**   | Tongue of Tongues     | Depths | Post-Exile | Accepts dream-Ky, mixed memory |
| **Theryn**   | The Burned Seer       | Solrael | Post-Exile | Demands visions, sacrifices clarity |
| *(Add more)* |                       |        |            |                |

## Minor Gods

These are emergent or regional deities — some still recognizable as Kynari in form, others symbolic projections.

| Name         | Title                  | Domain | Origin     | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Thalen**   | The Whisper Mirror     | Under  | Unknown    | Seen only in shrine echoes |
| **Lyshen**   | The Wound-Lantern      | Upper  | Forgotten  | Prefers sacrifice of memory |
| *(Add more)* |                        |        |            |       |

---

## Forgotten or Erased

These gods are no longer worshipped — either deliberately erased, lost to time, or absorbed by stronger deities.

| Name         | Last Known Title     | Status | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|--------|-------|
| **Vaereth**  | The Pale Wheel       | Erased | No shrine remains |
| **Xaleth**   | Of Mouths and Needles| Absorbed | Supposedly devoured by Zhar |
| *(Add more)* |                      |        |       |

## Gods by Domain

- **Upper Gods**: Associated with light, order, memory, purity, ritual structure.
- **Under Gods**: Aligned with darkness, chaos, fear, passion, forbidden knowledge.

Gods can **shift domains** or blur between them depending on shrine placement and colony interpretation.

## Gods by Biome Affinity

| Biome         | Notable Deities |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Fungal**    | Zhar, Ivraya     |
| **Ashen**     | Theryn, Lyshen   |
| **Crystalline** | Sol, Vaereth   |

## Divine Politics & Alliances

Gods have enemies, rivals, and allies — often in shifting arrangements.

- **Sol** refuses joint shrines with any Under God.
- **Ivraya** once allied with Thalen, now estranged.
- **Core-aligned deities** oppose Upper gods by nature, but not always by voice.

Some gods **react violently to worship of their enemies**, corrupting blessings or silencing shrine conduits.
