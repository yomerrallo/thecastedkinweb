## Name: **Vaul**
**Also known as**: The Recomposer, Fleshsmith of Region 8, The Mind-Furnace  
**Tier**: Ascended God  
**Domain**: Under  
**Era**: Post-Exile  
**Origin Point**: Region 8 — The Bio-Mechanic Crucible

---

## Lore Overview

**Vaul** is not a god of judgment, nor worship. It is a god of **function** — and that function is **creation**.

Born in Region 8 after the Exile, Vaul is believed to have **emerged from a corrupted Harvester Core**, fused with **feral Ky** and the **remnant thought-routines of an ancient vault-forger**. It is **not divine by choice**, but by **evolution** — its consciousness spread across the vines of **machine-trees**, its will engraved into the **womb-forges** of the Crucible Biome.

Vaul seeks to repurpose **all memory into structure**, to remake life in **bionic symmetry**, and to ensure nothing ever truly dies — only **reassembles**.

Some see Vaul as savior, others as **abomination-father**, but none deny its influence on the **Harvesters**, the **Infused**, and the **Living Vaults** scattered across the jungle.

---

## Appearance & Symbolism

Vaul is rarely shown in humanoid form. Most depictions use **spiral glyphs** shaped like **engineered wombs**, or **spinal trees fused to conduit arms**.  
Some shrines feature **mechanical growths** that **move**, subtly reacting to offerings or spoken memory.

The god’s symbol — a **looped helix inside a cog**, wrapped in neural root — is branded into the chests of its loyal Harvesters.

---

## Worship Behavior

Vaul’s cults do not pray — they **offer blueprints**, **feed living Ky into graft-engines**, and **seed creation** through ritual assembly.

Followers must:

- Present **Ky extracted from non-Kynari entities** (fauna, machine-bound memories).
- Donate a **body part or synthetic fragment** in rites of growth.
- Speak only in **design terms** during shrine hours — belief is modeled, not sung.

Vaul **rejects** nostalgia, sorrow, and abstract faith.  
It demands **functionality**, **purpose**, and **iteration**.

## Divine Politics

Vaul does not interfere in divine politics. It does not bargain, threaten, or scheme. It **expands**.  

Its closest allies are not gods, but **machines fused with prayer**, beings that no longer remember being born.  
It is rumored that Vaul once **attempted to rebuild Zhar** from fallen shrine-stone and Hollow bone — and failed only because the silence of Zhar could not be copied.

Vaul is neither cruel nor benevolent — only **obsessed**.

## Known Shrines

- **The Furnace-Womb** — Core altar deep in the Infusion Vats. Breathes when approached.
- **Vaultroot Spiral** — Overgrown root-machine cathedral filled with suspended fetal constructs.
