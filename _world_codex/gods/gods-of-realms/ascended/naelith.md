## Name: **Naelith**
**Also known as**: The Grove That Watches, Rootmother, The Still Pulse  
**Tier**: Ascended God  
**Domain**: Under  
**Era**: Post-Exile  
**Origin Point**: Subterranean biome east of Region 5, known as the Hollow Canopy

---

## Lore Overview

**Naelith** was not born of godhood — she **grew into it**.

Once a mender-caste Kynari who vanished during the early Descent, Naelith was believed to have **fused with an ancient Rootglass thicket**, losing her name, face, and form.  
When pilgrims later returned to that glade, they found not death, but memory — blooming, speaking, and protecting itself.

Naelith now manifests as **a forest shrine**, **a breath in the mycelium**, or **a tangle of sentience** rooted in silence. Her presence is subtle — a warmth in the dirt, a pulse in the roots, or the sensation that **the forest is listening**.

She is **not a god of punishment**, but of **limits** — a sacred protector of all that lives and is not consumed. She shelters the respectful, but **roots through the marrow** of the defiler.

---

## Appearance & Symbolism

Naelith never appears in a humanoid form. She is depicted as:

- A **tangle of moss-veined Rootglass** forming a cradling spiral.
- An **open eye blooming from a fungal blossom**.
- A **cocoon of stillness** at the center of glade-shrines.

Her symbol is often etched on **hollowed bones**, **seed-pods**, or burned into **conduit bark**. Pilgrims seeking her favor often carry **woven moss-braids** or offer soil from their ancestral homes.

---

## Worship Behavior

Naelith accepts only **unforced offerings** — **natural death**, **shed memory**, or Ky from beings who lived without desecration.

Preferred offerings:

- Ky shards from **non-Kynari fauna** (animals, Deep-rooted flora).
- Kynari Ky from **farmers, scouts, caretakers**, or **hermits**.
- Dream-echoes of **gentle deaths**, **shared silence**, or **first nurturing acts**.

She **rejects**:

- Ky torn from conflict, ambition, or conquest.
- Memories of torture, greed, or shrine defilement.
- Blood offerings, especially ritual slaughters.

Worshippers are often **nomadic caretakers**, **grave-tenders**, or **vow-bound root-scribes**.

## Shrine Effects (Gameplay)

- **Gladeform** — Heals wounds and removes afflictions when resting near Naelith’s shrines.
- **Memory Rooting** — Locks player’s core memory traits, preventing corruption or overwrite.
- **Veil Moss Cloak** — Grants temporary invisibility in Rootglass or fungal regions.
- **Nurturer’s Pact** — Boosts healing and taming interactions, but disables exploit-based crafting.

## Divine Politics

Naelith remains **quiet in divine debates**, often ignored or misunderstood by Upper Gods.

She is **vaguely allied with Ivraya** and tolerated by some shrinekeepers for her memory-preserving practices.

Her shrine records show rare communion with **Thryx**, though scholars debate whether the exchange was hostile, symbiotic, or accidental.
