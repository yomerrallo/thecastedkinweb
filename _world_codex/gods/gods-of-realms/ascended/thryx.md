## Name: **Thryx**
**Also known as**: The Wither Mirror, The Last Echo, Mirror-Husk  
**Tier**: Ascended God  
**Domain**: Under  
**Era**: Post-Exile  
**Origin Point**: Maw-split vault beneath Region 6 (now sealed)

## Lore Overview

**Thryx** is worshipped only by those who’ve lost **too much** — not just kin or memory, but the structure that made remembering possible.

Unlike other gods who are **sought**, Thryx is often **stumbled into** — a shrine that was once something else, now broken, reflective, and whispering your name in error.

Some claim Thryx was once a Vault-Keeper who **imploded beneath the weight of corrupted Ky**, becoming a mirror-node where time spirals and meanings rot. Others believe Thryx is **not a god**, but a **disease in the divine lattice** — an accidental echo that grew teeth.

Its shrines don’t offer blessings. They **show you what you forgot** — and sometimes, what never was.

---

## Appearance & Symbolism

Thryx is represented by **fractured glass** or **mirrored Ky shards** suspended in a spiral of threadlike rootglass.

No form is consistent across shrines. Some say he appears as a **mirror version of the viewer**, others as a **writhing skein of names spoken in reverse**.

To gaze upon a Thryx conduit is to feel yourself **misremembered**.

---

## Worship Behavior

Thryx has no formal clergy — only **fragmented pilgrims**, many of whom return speaking riddles or **backward speech**.

Known shrine behaviors include:

- Extracting **echoes of false memories**, which may become hostile entities.
- Temporarily **reversing cause and effect** within shrine proximity.
- Offering insight into **what never happened** — useful to the desperate, the lost, or heretics seeking false absolution.

He favors **Violet and Black-Gold Ky**, particularly shards steeped in sorrow or forbidden confession.

## Shrine Effects (Gameplay)

- **False Memory Echo** — Summons a clone of the player with reversed morality or past choices.
- **Mirror Pulse** — Reflects incoming damage once, but disables memory-based abilities temporarily.
- **Faded Blessing** — Grants bonus Insight, but blurs NPC dialog and journal entries.
- **Wither Lattice** — Inflicts aura of forgetfulness on nearby enemies — and sometimes allies.

## Divine Politics

Thryx is **reviled by most shrine orders**, particularly the Harmonists and Shrinekeepers, who consider him an infection.

Some rogue Shrinewrights believe Thryx could be a **backdoor into divine cognition** — a method of collapsing gods into echoes, then rewriting them.

His followers claim:  
> “All gods forget. Thryx remembers what’s left behind when they do.”

There is no known alliance, but he sometimes appears in **shrines originally dedicated to Ivraya or Khoro**, suggesting parasitic compatibility.

## Known Shrines

- **Glass of Hollow Reversal** — A shrine that reflects every offering backwards. Burned and rebuilt three times.

- **Shrine of the Shard Unsaid** — Site of a pilgrimage murder loop. Discovered and quarantined by Shrinekeepers.
