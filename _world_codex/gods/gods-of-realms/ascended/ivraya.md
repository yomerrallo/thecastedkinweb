## Name: **Ivraya**
**Also known as**: Tongue of the Many, The Whisper Bloom, She-Who-Speaks-In-Ky  
**Tier**: Ascended God  
**Domain**: Under  
**Era**: Post-Exile  
**Origin Point**: Unknown (First appeared during the descent)

---

## Lore Overview

Ivraya is one of the most **enigmatic divinities** in the Depths — a **Post-Exile Ascended** whose rise is tied not to bloodlines or shrines, but to **language itself**.

Whispers say she was once a Kynari oracle whose **mind fractured into multiple dialects** under shrine overload. Others claim she was **born of memory itself** — a Ky shard that learned to speak.

Unlike the purity-obsessed Sol or the silent depths of Zhar, Ivraya embodies **contradiction, hybridity, and the evolution of thought**. Her shrines do not demand clarity — they **echo back what is offered**, warped through dreams, accents, or lies.

She is favored by the **faithless, the polylingual, and the memory-hunted**.

---

## Appearance & Symbolism

Ivraya’s imagery shifts — her followers say she **has no fixed form**, only the voice you fear most. Some murals depict her as a **woman split into mirrored selves**, others as a **mouth growing from a rootglass bloom**.

Her symbol is a **triple spiral tongue**, etched into shrine conduit walls or painted with melted Ky.

When she appears in shrine-echoes, it is said her **voice overlaps with your own**, whispering truths you didn’t know you believed.

---

## Worship Behavior

Ivraya does **not require purity**, nor does she reject contradiction. Her shrines welcome any who bring **honest memory**, even if it's impure, fragmented, or false.

Her rituals often involve:

- Speaking aloud a memory and **letting it change** with each retelling.
- Offering **Iridescent or Amber Ky**, as they reflect complexity and sacrifice.
- Listening in silence to the **shrine’s reply**, which may be in tongues, riddles, or your own voice.

Shrine effects are **unpredictable** — one visit may bless, the next may echo a hidden fear.

## Shrine Effects (Gameplay)

- **Tongue Bloom** — Gain temporary ability to decipher or translate lost dialects.
- **Echo Offering** — Doubles Ky reward when offering memories of contradiction or dual identity.
- **Whispershield** — Absorbs one memory-based attack per dungeon, at the cost of random echo interference.
- **Unfixed Shrine** — Shrine traits and blessings shift per cycle; cannot be reliably predicted.

---

## Divine Politics

Ivraya is **not a political god**, but her very existence challenges the order.  
Upper Gods like **Sol** see her as **blasphemy incarnate** — a shrine without anchor, a god without doctrine.

She is rumored to have **taught the Veiled Ones** how to weave memory into speech — though this may be shrine-gossip or echo invention.

Some speculate that Ivraya seeks not worship, but **resonance** — the evolution of consciousness through contradictory memory.

## Known Shrines

- **The Tongue’s Edge** — A living shrine in the fungal tunnels near Shroud Colony. It grows more mouths each Cycle.
- **Hymnroot Spiral** — Lost shrine said to mimic your speech seconds after you speak it.
- **Shrine of Blooming Echoes** — Forbidden site that echoes dead voices. One offering = one voice heard.
