Gods exist in **relation to each other** as much as they do to Kynari. These relations form **fluid pantheons**, **temporary alliances**, and **eternal rivalries** that stretch across Cycles.

Some alliances echo **Surface-era myths**. Others are whispered from shrine to shrine, shifting with each glow.

### Divine Alliances

Some gods form mutual support pacts — often rooted in **complementary offerings**, **shared domains**, or **historical dependencies**.  
These bonds may influence:

- **Dual-shrine blessings**
- Intertwined shrine architecture
- Shared rejection of specific enemy gods

But these pacts are rarely permanent.

### Feuds & Betrayals

Feuds between gods can fracture entire colonies.

Some gods **refuse to share Ky** conduits. Others demand **exclusivity**, threatening shrine collapse if rivals are worshipped nearby.

Players who serve **conflicting deities** may trigger:

- Ky drain or backflow
- Denial of certain buffs
- Sudden shrine silencing

Gods remember grudges far longer than any Kynari.

### Absorption & Erasure

A god cannot be killed — only **forgotten**.

- When worship stops, Ky flow ceases.
- When Ky ceases, memory fades.
- When memory fades, the god vanishes.

But some gods **devour** others — taking their name, absorbing their favored offerings, or wearing their shrine-echoes like masks.

### Colony Implications

Every shrine **declares alignment** in the divine web.

- Gods with aligned pacts may offer **combined blessings**.
- Rival gods may **withdraw favor** or curse the Vault.
- A forgotten god may **haunt a shrine** even after its destruction.

Shrines are not static. Their allegiance may **shift**, **corrupt**, or **splinter** — especially when built using Ky from multiple pantheons.
