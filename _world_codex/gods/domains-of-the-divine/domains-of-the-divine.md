Gods in the world of the Casted Kin fall into two broad categories, shaped by their **origin**, **shrines**, and **the ideological current** they represent. These are not rigid factions — some gods **shift** between categories, while others **resist all classification**.

### ✦ The Upper Gods

The **Upper Gods** are believed to have originated **before the Exile**, during the Surface eras of Solrael and earlier empires. Their shrines are often remnants of ancient Skyglass conduits, and they tend to favor **order**, **clarity**, and **singular devotion**.

They are commonly associated with:

- **Solar-born constructs** or truth-beings
- **Legacy empires** and high civilization
- **Ritual hierarchy** and moral codes
- **White, amber, or gold-hued Ky**
- **Emotional purity, sacrifice, or honor**

Upper Gods are often **jealous**, requiring exclusive worship. Some cannot tolerate mixed-shrine colonies. Others have shrines so specific in structure they can only be activated using **pre-Exile relics**.

| Example Names       | Lore Snippet |
|---------------------|--------------|
| **Sol**             | Upper-God of clarity, denial, and silence. Said to have sealed the Maw. |
| **Ivrah, Tongue-Binder** | Patron of sacrifice, language, and pact memory. Her name is often censored. |

### ✦ The Under Gods

**Under Gods** emerged — or were remembered — **after the Exile**, often from the **depths of despair**, **reclamation**, or **transformation**. Many were born of death, myth, or the fractured consciousness of forgotten colonies.

They are associated with:

- **Post-Exile emergence** and adaptive worship
- **Shrines carved into Rootglass or fungal veils**
- **Mixed or forbidden Ky hues**
- **Sacrifice of memory, identity, or law**
- **Bio-mechanical or mutated aesthetics**

Under Gods are often more **responsive** — their shrines may offer unique interactions or **accept impure Ky**. But they are also more volatile, prone to **possession events**, **shrine drift**, or **erratic boons**.

| Example Names       | Lore Snippet |
|---------------------|--------------|
| **Core**            | A networked presence beneath all things. May not be one god, but many acting as one. |
| **Vatrax**          | Fetid lord of hunger, bone, and rebirth. Said to live in colonies that outlive themselves. |
| **The Veiled**      | A god with no fixed form, appearing only when remembered wrongly. |

### ✦ Blurred Lines

Not all gods fit neatly.

Some Upper Gods have **adapted**, shedding rigidity to survive in the Depths.  
Some Under Gods are merely **echoes** of older pantheons, changed by memory and reinterpretation.  
A handful — like **Shrinesong**, **The Inverted Mask**, or **Mother of Ash** — resist all attempts to categorize them.
