### ✦ Elder Gods (Tier 3)

**Ancient. Immense. Often silent.**  
Elder Gods are entities of **pre-Exile** origin or **unknown age**, said to predate Solrael or to have formed around cosmic or metaphysical events. They don’t merely accept offerings — they **consume belief** as structure.

They are:

- Infrequent in shrine appearance
- Often **biome-bound**, tied to specific regions or deep phenomena
- Terrifying in influence — blessings may cause side effects
- Unwilling to speak directly, communicating through **shrine drift**, **Ky pulses**, or **echo dreams**.

| Traits                                        | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| Always god-tier: `ELDER`                      | Indicates highest divine classification; not player-ascendable. |
| Rarely accessible to players at start         | Shrines may only unlock after major narrative events or in deep regions. |
| Buffs tend to be **area-wide** or **passive metaphysical shifts** | Effects might alter biomes, colony pulse, or enemy behavior subtly. |
| May **refuse shrines** unless rare conditions are met | Conditions include mass offerings, certain Ky hues, or aligned relics. |

Examples:  
- **Sol** — Upper-God of silence and denial  
- **The Veiled** — Under-entity formed from forgotten tongues  
- **Core** — An omnipresent whispering consciousness in Rootglass

### ✦ Ascended Gods (Tier 2)

**They were like us once. Some still are.**  
Ascended Gods are **Kynari**, **fauna**, or **machines** that crossed a divine threshold — usually via accumulated Ky, ritual sacrifice, or mass shrine convergence. Some colonies **deliberately raise** ascendants.

They are:

- More **interactive** than Elder Gods  
- Highly tied to **emotion**, **legacy**, or **cause of death**  
- Often **localized** to specific regions or cultures  
- Still evolving — may **gain or lose power** over Cycles

| Traits                                        | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| god-tier: `ASCENDED`                          | Mid-tier gods that originated from mortal or material life. |
| May have once had player-like stats or names  | Their past identity may appear in dreams, relics, or dungeon echoes. |
| Shrine designs reflect **origin**             | Shrines resemble who or what they were — e.g. armor, bone, ruins. |
| Can sometimes **speak directly** to players   | Through shrine murmurs, memory-pools, or interaction sequences. |

Examples:  
- **Ivraya of Tongues** — Said to have wept for the Ky of orphans and became their voice  
- **The Saint of Ash** — Burned alive in a vault collapse; now answers prayers from flame-born shrines  
- **Shrinesong** — A harmonist who fed her voice into Rootglass until it became a melody-god

### ✦ Minor Gods (Tier 1)

**Hungry, localized, and loud.**  
Minor gods are **incipient divinities** — Kynari too saturated with Ky to remain mortal, or micro-gods generated by **shrine-memories**, **collective fear**, or **mnemonic glitch**. They are unstable and often strange.

They are:

- Colony- or shrine-specific  
- Prone to **rapid mood swings** based on offerings or player actions  
- Potentially **ascendable** or extinguishable  
- Known to **possess**, **vanish**, or **fight** each other

| Traits                                        | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| god-tier: `MINOR`                             | Lowest divine tier; some still mortal or unstable in essence. |
| Many start as unnamed                         | Players or events may grant their name through offerings or deeds. |
| Favor offerings reflecting trauma or obsession | These gods are shaped by intense experiences or localized myths. |
| Can be **killed**, in rare cases              | Killing may erase them or splinter their Ky into cursed relics. |

Examples:  
- **The Blinking One** — Appears only in dreams, demands blinking contests at shrine  
- **Vul Orra** — Feeds on betrayal. First appeared during a colony civil war  
- **Ashwrithe** — God of soot, memory fog, and forgetting your own name
