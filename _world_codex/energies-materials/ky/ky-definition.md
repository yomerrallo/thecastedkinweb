## What Is Ky

**Ky** is the divine inheritance — a **borrowed spark** granted by the gods at birth, meant to be **returned** upon death.

It is not soul, not breath, not blood.  
It is **the echo of presence** — a living signature that grows with experience.

Ky is the **currency of memory**, the **fuel of shrines**, and the **root of all worth** in both Surface and Depths.

It can be **offered**, **stored**, **spent**, or **sacrificed**.  
It can be **taken**, and in rare cases, **reused**.

## The Flow of Ky

Ky exists in two known states:

- **Fluid Ky**: Present in the living, liquid and luminous. Responsive to experiences — pleasure, pain, revelation, sin.  
- **Crystallized Ky**: Forms **almost immediately** after death. Hardened into faceted shards or fragments, often still **warm with memory**.

Though all experiences feed Ky, some **enrich** it more than others — sacrifice, fear, love, and trauma are particularly potent.

> “It remembers how you lived. It shines differently for each sin.”

## Hollowing & Infusion

Most Ky **hardens** quickly — inert, valuable, mnemonic.  
But **Harvesters** — deep-tech entities of the Depths — are capable of extracting **still-liquid Ky**, preserving it before crystalization.

This form of Ky can be **infused** into organic or synthetic vessels, used in high-tier rituals, or repurposed by forbidden technologies.

Many Hollowed lose themselves in the process.  
Some return, **carrying voices not their own**.

---

## Ky & Skyglass

In both Surface and Depths, **Skyglass** (called *Veinglass* or *Deepglass* in distant regions) forms a **root-like filament system** through the world.

These **threads** — invisible to most, but humming to harmonists — carry Ky like **mycelium** carries water and nutrient.

When Ky is **offered in shrines**, it **melts**, reverting to fluid state, and **flows along the Skyglass network** toward its god.

- The stronger the shrine, the purer the transmission.
- The more faithful the offering, the brighter the flame.

The gods are **not omnipresent** — but Ky makes them near.

---

## Ky as Memory

Ky is **lived memory** — and so it is feared, valued, traded.

- Crystallized Ky can retain **ghost-impressions** of its bearer.
- Some are pure, others **resist reuse**, clinging to selfhood.
- In the colonies, to say *“I carry your Ky”* is to say *“I remember you.”*

Certain rituals allow priests or machines to **read** Ky — extracting dreams, sins, or **choices never made**.

---

## Rarity and Use

Ky Shards serve many roles:

- **Spiritual offerings** at shrines
- **Currency** in markets, especially for rare goods or favors
- **Building materials** for powered conduits and Vaultlight pillars
- **Weapon catalysts** and **infusion reagents**

> Whether it fuels a god or a grenade, the value is the same:  
> **What was once lived. What can be used again.**

## Lore & Origin Myths

Where does Ky come from? No myth agrees.

- **The Core Faithful** say it is the heartbeat of the Core itself.
- **The Shrinekeepers** believe it is the debt of existence — a loan repaid in light.
- **The Loyalists** say Sol — the supreme Upper-God — embedded Ky in flesh so that the gods could feed on what they could never be.

> “We are borrowed light, acting like flame.”  
> — Pilgrim mantra, inscribed Cycle 1.1

## Pulse vs Ky

**The Pulse** is the rhythm.  
**Ky** is the story.

- The Pulse keeps time.  
- Ky **fills** it — with meaning, identity, consequence.

One binds us.  
The other **divides**.
