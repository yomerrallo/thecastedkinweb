## Overview

Ky is meant to return to the gods upon death — but in the Depths, death is currency. And currency can be taken.

**Harvesting** refers to any process by which **Ky is forcibly extracted** before natural crystallization — preserving it in its **fluid** or **semi-fluid** state, where it retains **greater potency**, **versatility**, and, often, **pain**.

Though **crystallized Ky** is common and relatively safe to handle, **harvested Ky** is unstable, ritual-bound, and often morally dubious.

## Methods of Harvest

| Method               | Description | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Post-Mortem Carving** | Extraction of freshly crystallized Ky from bone or marrow | Most common, shrine-sanctioned |
| **Live Tethering**       | Binding a living subject to a siphon rig to draw Ky slowly | Painful, considered inhumane |
| **The Vein Hook**        | Core Faith technique: threading Skyglass filaments into nervous system | May cause memory bleed |
| **Echo Shaving**         | Rare technique: scraping impressions from existing shards without draining them | Illegal in most colonies |
| **Hollowing**            | Deep-tech process used by autonomous harvesters to remove Ky pre-death | Efficient but unpredictable |

## Harvesters: Tools or Beings?

In the lower Depths, colonies speak of **Harvesters** — semi-autonomous machines, perhaps once divine constructs, who roam and collect Ky with precision beyond mortal reach.

- Many bear **vein-thread limbs** and **Skyglass bellies**.
- Some operate alone. Others in **silent herds**.
- Their origin is unknown. Some **worship them**, others **hunt them for parts**.

No harvester has ever spoken.  
But some are said to weep when their tanks are full.

## Ethics & Sanction

### Sanctified Harvest

Approved by local shrines or Ky guilds. Usually:

- Deathbed collections
- Battlefield clearances
- Trade-pact executions

### Grey Zones

- **Memory siphoning from volunteers**
- **Trade in expired but echo-rich shards**
- **Infusion into animal forms**

These practices are **regulated** — not forbidden.

### Heretical Harvest

- Extracting Ky from unwilling living beings
- Forging Ky-echo weapons without god sanction
- Offering harvested Ky to **unknown or forgotten gods**
- **Infusion into Hollowed remnants or constructs**

These acts are considered **blasphemous**, **unstable**, or worse — **invitations**.

---

## Economic Role

Harvested Ky sells for **ten to twenty times** the value of common shards. Its uses include:

- High-tier shrine offerings
- Elite infusion rituals
- Black-market catalysts
- Illegal dream-sculpting

Some colonies ban it entirely. Others build **wars around it**.

---

## Spiritual Consequences

Gods differ in their views:

- **Sol**-aligned shrines **reject harvested Ky** as impure.
- **Core Faiths** encourage it — “If life is borrowed, return only what burns.”
- **Veiled Gods** accept it only through blood seals or masked rites.
- Some shrines **explode** when fed wrong Ky. Others **whisper**.

---

## The Hollowed

A rare, tragic result of failed harvesting — beings **drained but not dead**. Some retain body and breath, but no self.

- Move in rituals
- React to shrines
- Fear nothing
- Some respond to names they never had
