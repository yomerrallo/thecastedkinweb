## Overview

Not all Ky is created equal. While all living beings are seeded with Ky at birth, its **hue**, **clarity**, and **resonance tier** vary widely based on **how** life was lived — and **how** death occurred.

Scholars, shrine-keepers, and Ky-traders alike use **Hue & Tier Classification** to identify the strength, usability, and potential sanctity (or danger) of crystallized Ky.

## Hue: The Spectrum of Memory

A Ky shard’s **color** reflects the emotional and mnemonic weight of its bearer’s experiences. Though not absolute, this spectrum offers insight into what the shard “remembers.”

| Hue              | Typical Emotional Echo           | Notes |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Pale Blue**     | Wonder, first loves, discovery    | Common in early deaths or artist castes |
| **Emerald Green** | Curiosity, growth, adaptation     | Seen in pilgrims, scouts |
| **Amber**         | Loyalty, burden, self-sacrifice   | Favored by shrines of Ivraya |
| **Crimson**       | Anger, vengeance, glory           | Valued by militant gods, volatile in vaults |
| **Violet**        | Sorrow, longing, unresolved grief | Difficult to repurpose, high in dream-echo |
| **Black-Gold**    | Revelation, heresy, forbidden truth | Rare, sometimes rejected by shrines |
| **White-Clear**   | Clarity, devotion, unbroken faith | Highly pure — too bright for some conduits |
| **Gray-Dull**     | Regret, stagnation, numbness      | Often unstable, fades quickly |
| **Iridescent**    | Mixed echoes, high mnemonic load  | Ritual-only use — considered dangerous |

## Tier: Resonance Levels

Tiers define **how much energy and memory a shard contains**, and whether it can be safely used, infused, or traded. Tiers are influenced by **lifetime depth**, **manner of death**, and **divine favor**.

| Tier | Classification      | Use Cases | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Tier 0** | Dust | Useless, degraded | Dead zones, cursed remnants |
| **Tier 1** | Faint | Basic offerings, torchlight fuel | Common |
| **Tier 2** | Viable | Currency-grade, shrine-standard | Trade safe |
| **Tier 3** | Potent | Vault-use, infusion-grade | Attracts god-echo |
| **Tier 4** | Rare | Artifact forging, elite catalysts | Causes shrine resonance |
| **Tier 5** | Mythic | Forbidden rites, god-vision, echo-walking | Nearly unstable |

Some colonies have their own local variants, but the above is accepted by the **Shrine Consortium**, the closest thing to an inter-colony Ky standard.

## Shard Traits & Exceptions

Some shards are misclassified or defy all known categories. Notable anomalies include:

- **Singing Shards**: Vibrate in tune with shrine pulses. Said to contain partial awareness.
- **Mourning Cores**: Crystallize in circular structures, often unbreakable. Formed during collective death events.
- **Ashlock Shards**: Appear pure white but reject offering. May contain counterfeit memories.

## Shrine Alignment

Gods are drawn to certain hues — and repelled by others. Though not fixed, most shrines **resonate stronger** with shards whose hue aligns with their nature.

| God / Pantheon       | Preferred Hue(s) | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Sol (Upper-God)**         | White, Amber      | Rejects Black-Gold shards |
| **Core (Under-God Network)** | Crimson, Violet   | Does not reject impurity |
| **Ivraya of Tongues**       | Amber, Iridescent | Accepts mixed-hue shards |
| **The Veiled Ones**         | Black-Gold, Violet | Only usable through veil shrines |
| **The Forgotten**           | Gray, Ash          | Accept loss, resist purity |
