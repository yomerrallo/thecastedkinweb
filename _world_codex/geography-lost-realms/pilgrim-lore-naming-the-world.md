## Overview: A World Partially Forgotten

Most maps of the world before the Exile have been **lost, sealed, or erased** — not by time, but by **divine interference**. The Solar Conclave forbade cartography beyond the Seven-Terrace Core of Solrael. The Under-Gods, by contrast, offer visions not of places, but of **impressions** — a pulse of what was once felt, not what was seen.

After the Shattering, a group of survivors known as the **Pilgrims of the Fractured Meridian** began to record the world again — not in ink, but in **Ky-trails, dream-maps, and resonance paths**. These Pilgrims were rarely settlers. They wandered, listened, and **named** what had been unnamed.

To this day, many places above and below are known only through their **Pilgrim name**, not their original title.

## The Act of Naming

In Kynari tradition, naming a place is not simply a label — it is a **binding**, an act of remembrance, a claim of memory made physical. To name something is to anchor it in the Ky-web of the world.

### Forms of Naming:
- **True Names** — Original titles given during Solrael's golden age. Rarely preserved.
- **Pilgrim Names** — Designations given by explorers, dream-seers, or those who returned from exile paths.
- **Conclave Renamings** — Political rebranding, often overwriting places associated with heresy or under-gods.
- **Forbidden Names** — Names believed to invoke echo-threads or dead gods. Speaking them aloud may resonate.

> “You must walk a name before you wear it,” the saying goes. Pilgrim maps require **experience** — one must travel the place before the map reveals itself.

---

## Pilgrims of the Fractured Meridian

The most famous naming sect, founded around **Cycle 1.3**, was composed of:
- **Ky Echo Readers**
- **Shardwalkers**
- **Resonance Weavers**
- **Cartomancers**

They operated in the **border zones** — between Depths and Surface, between colonies and ruins. Their goal was not conquest, but **memory recovery**. They left no written maps, only **Ky-thread lattices**, **chant-scrolls**, and **story-ink tattoos** that could only be read while traveling.

Most colonies owe their earliest names and orientation to these Pilgrims, not to Conclave records or Depth cartography.

## World Memory After the Shattering

After the Exile, memory fragmentation became endemic:
- Shrines no longer remembered who they served.
- Ky crystals carried **incomplete echoes**.
- Skyglass resonated to false tones in abandoned cities.
- Some locations “vanished” until renamed — a process that re-established their presence in the collective mind.

> “Places disappear when no one remembers them. Some were never named in the first place.”  
> — From the Chant of Returning Paths

## Named Regions of Pilgrim Record

The Pilgrims of the Fractured Meridian, after initiating their memory-mapping of the post-Exile world, turned increasingly to the act of **naming** — not merely to mark, but to stabilize. These names functioned not as labels, but as **anchors against forgetfulness**, each one binding a region into collective memory.
 Many of the locations known today in both the Depths and the Surface owe their continued existence to these chant-names.

Pilgrim-named regions are often categorized by their orientation relative to Solrael and the Maw.

---

### Upper Halo (Surface-Adjoining)

- **The Wane Marches**  
  A dead zone of sun-burned earth west of Solrael. Said to be where light no longer carries Ky and shadows move on their own. Considered cursed.  

- **Sunglint Spine**  
  A broken mountain range to the northeast, where some claim an old solar observatory still receives divine resonance. Location uncertain.

- **The Pale Verge**  
  Where the Dome ends and the world frays. Filled with shattered Skyglass filaments and the ruined frames of unbuilt shrines. Pilgrims report vertigo and voice-loss here.

---

### Borderlands Below (Pre-Colony Depth Zones)

- **The Hollow Tongue**  
  A winding tunnel fork said to have no end — only curve. Echoes here are inverted and can cause memory bleed. Used in old tests for Shrinekeeper initiates.  

- **Fathomglen**  
  A vast, fungal cavern filled with translucent root-flora. Claimed by early pilgrims to hum in response to under-god chant. Possibly the site of a vanished colony.  

- **Virell’s Grasp**  
  Not a place, but a path. A Pilgrim route between Depth fissures marked by dying lightbeetles. The name is spoken only at the beginning and end — never during.

---

### Inferred or Mythic Zones

- **The Ironsong Horizon**  
  Referenced in a shard-etched scroll from Cycle 1.6. Described as “a field where broken gods lie singing.” No maps contain it, but two pilgrims were found with matching fragments.  

- **The Salt Coil**  
  Believed to be a spiral fault zone far south of the Maw. Said to preserve fossil-Ky from the pre-Solrael era. Considered sacred and fatal.  

- **Ylna’s Mirror**  
  A name that appears in over a dozen chant-cycles, but no one knows what it refers to — a place, person, or shrine. Its appearance in fragment-Ky patterns is statistically anomalous.

---

## The Naming Instinct

Pilgrims often described an overwhelming **urge to name** as they passed through certain environments. Some called it "resonance panic" — a phenomenon where a place's identity begins to collapse unless remembered in language.

> “I felt it slipping. The tunnel. It had no grip. So I named it.”  
> — Testimony of Rescar Muth, First Meridian Cycle 1.4

Scholars now believe some regions of the world possess **semi-stable mnemonic resonance** — meaning they remain physically present only while collectively remembered or named. Without a name, they **dissolve**, or shift into inaccessible folds of space.

---

## Lost Zones and Unfixed Places

A class of Pilgrim-named regions known as “Lost Zones” refer to places:
- That no longer appear on maps or in Ky-echoes
- That only exist during specific Pulses
- That cannot be reached twice by the same path

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| The Gray Vault | A ruin of books made of flaking ash. Located once. Never found again. | Presumed memory collapse. |
| Tresk Underline | Tunnel where names burn out of memory. Used in exile trials. | Now forbidden. |
| The Pulse Well | A place where the Pulse slows or silences entirely. Claimed to be below the Salt Coil. | Considered a death-prayer. |

---

To this day, some pilgrims vanish with their names etched into bone or Ky-stone. Their bodies are never found — only their **maps**, still humming, still naming.

## Naming Taboos and Forbidden Names

Some names are not preserved — they are **avoided**.

Pilgrims recorded a class of locations and concepts called **Unnamables** — not because they lacked titles, but because **uttering their names triggered resonance anomalies**: Ky implosions, shrine silencing, memory distortion, or collapse of neural patterning. These names became ritual taboos, marked with glyphs designed not to be read, but buried.

### Known Taboos:
- **Rhyss-Vaen** — The so-called City of Reversed Echoes. Naming it within shrine-echo range is believed to invert Ky flow in unprotected listeners.
- **Tahril’s Mark** — A shrike-shaped fault west of the Wane Marches. Naming it may induce dream-conflation in the same Glow.
- **Unnamed Fourth City** — A place referenced by multiple chants but always skipped in enumeration. Believed to have been excised from Ky entirely.

> “What the gods forget, we must never recall.”  
> — Refrain of the Weavers Below, Cycle 2.2

Some theorists believe these taboos are not natural, but **imposed by divine encryption protocols** — safeguards encoded into Ky flow to prevent “memory reclamation errors.”

---

## Reverse Pilgrimages

While the early pilgrims moved outward and downward, **later sects attempted to move back upward** — toward Solrael or rumored surface shrines. These were the **Reverse Pilgrims**, often operating alone or in disguised colonies.

Their goal was not just reconnection — but to determine what of the world above **still remembered them**.

### Documented Reverse Routes:
- **The Veinway Ascent** — A collapsed Ky extraction shaft believed to intersect an upper Skyglass corridor. Now sealed.
- **Flamebreak Spiral** — A resonance-scarred spiral path leading upward from a Depth sanctuary. Known to cause time drift and perception bleed.
- **The Maw (Inversion Route)** — The most famous, though only partially successful. At least three groups ascended in Cycle 2.6; none returned.

While many of these attempts failed, rumors persist that **some Reverse Pilgrims made it** — and left offerings in surface shrines where none had been for generations.

---

## Legacy of the Fractured Meridian

The original Pilgrims of the Fractured Meridian left no official doctrine — only trails of Ky-markings, chant-cycles, and echo-inferred glyphwork. Today, their influence lingers in many subtle ways:

- **Shrinekeeper chants** still use fragments of their navigational hymns.
- **Ky-weavers** map new Depth tunnels using their echo-structure logic.
- **Returnist mythographers** cite them as precursors to surface reconquest.
- **Conclave inquisitors** still search for their remaining scrolls, calling them “cartographic heresy.”

Some modern factions claim to descend from them in ideology:
- **The Ashmile Chanters** — who believe naming stabilizes divine thought.
- **The Vaultless Line** — who refuse maps entirely, walking by resonance only.
- **The Circle of Fifth Tongue** — who preserve forbidden names as a sacrament.

---

## Integration Into Colonial Knowledge

Most current colonies in the Depths derive their local names, perimeter markers, and memory-vault anchors from **Pilgrim designations**. However, only some acknowledge the source. Others have:

- **Conclave-Renamed** sites for doctrinal control.
- **Factional Overwrites**, e.g., Loyalist maps that scrub under-god zones.
- **Mnemonic Compression**, where three or more ancient names are merged into one simplified label.

For example:
- “The Fracture of Blue Silence” → “Resonance Vault 9-A” (Loyalist charts)
- “Rootcoil of Virell” → “Murk Route Delta”
- “Unnamed but Dream-Held Place” → expunged entirely from Torchseer archives

In short: the world still uses Pilgrim memory, but often **without admitting it**.
