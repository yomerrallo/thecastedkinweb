## Overview

They called it **Solrael** ‚Äî the City of Light‚Äôs Grace, though that name was always a translation, never a truth. To the faithful, it was the world‚Äôs axis. To the exiled, a wound that never healed.

Solrael was not merely a city ‚Äî it was a *theological engine*. Built into the stone cradle of a deep, mineral-rich valley, it spiraled upward through seven great terraces carved into Skyglass and blood-sung crystal. The city hummed. It breathed. Its dome was tuned not to hold out the world, but to *resonate with gods* ‚Äî a harmony chamber meant to receive favor from the heavens.

That dome cracked at midmorning on the 12th Glow of Cycle 0.  
Not everywhere ‚Äî just above the Fifth Terrace.  
Just enough.

The Solar Conclave called it a tragedy.  
The Veiled Synod called it a message.  
The Casted now call it the **first lie**.

Solrael still stands. Its towers shine. Its spires glisten with captured Ky. Its shrines thrum with artificial divinity. But for those below, its name is not holy ‚Äî it's a curse wrapped in memory. A place that did not collapse but *selected* who would be remembered and who would be erased.

There are those who say the sun itself was bound into the dome ‚Äî that Solrael became its keeper.  
And those cast out? They were not denied light.  
They were denied *access to the divine bandwidth*.

## Structure & Geography

Solrael was designed in the image of **symmetry as sacred law**. It is a city of rising concentric terraces, each shaped like a flattened arc, connected through the vertical spine of the **Spinal Column** ‚Äî a central tower carved from Skyglass-veined ore that served as conduit, archive, and gate.

Each terrace was carved from the valley walls, its edges feathering toward the heart like the layered petals of a flower, or the rings of a tree cut open to expose its years. The entire city followed a slope ‚Äî not circular, but coiled ‚Äî like a staircase of civilizations spiraling around a fixed divine nerve.

### Key Features:

#### üúÇ **The Spinal Column**
- A vertical pillar at the city‚Äôs core, connecting all terraces physically and energetically.
- Serves as the **nervous system** of Solrael: channels Ky offerings, echoes Skyglass harmonics, controls shrine access.
- Houses the **Dome-Harmonist Tower**, memory chambers, and sealed catacombs known only to the Conclave.
- Some claim the gods of light once *nested* within its latticework, bound in ritual and reflection.

#### üúÅ **The Skyglass Dome**
- Engineered by lost architect-priests, layered with harmonic script and divine equations.
- Did not cover the whole city ‚Äî only the top five terraces.  
- **Segmented by shrine frequency**, each part of the dome could shift in color, tone, and temperature according to ritual.
- In high rituals, the dome would **sing**, and the city beneath would respond ‚Äî buildings gently vibrating, light refracting like water over the skin.
- Some believe Skyglass is not merely conduit ‚Äî but a *housing* for divine presence itself. When a god was worshipped properly, it was said they could inhabit the dome *directly*, emerging in light and song.

#### üúÉ **The River Viruun**
- A pale, slow-moving river cuts through the lowest terraces and coils beneath the city.  
- Used for ritual washing, Ky-cooling rites, and body returns. Some believe it carries **shrine-rejected Ky** out of the city and into the Depths.
- Rumors persist that the river connects, through forgotten chambers, to ancient Under-God shrines ‚Äî a claim dismissed by Conclave officials.

#### üúÑ **Periphery Settlements**
- Scattered watchstations and mining encampments once dotted the valley rim.
- Many of these were abandoned after the Exile. Some became **pilgrimage traps** or flame-warded prisons.
- Loyalists and Returnists today use their ruins for contact points in surface operations.

## The Seven Terraces

Each terrace of Solrael represented a rung on the sacred spiral of ascension ‚Äî physically higher, spiritually nearer to the divine. While movement between them was not forbidden, it was tightly regulated. Access often required divine favor, ritual clearance, or high-Ky lineage.

Below is an overview of each terrace, arranged from highest (1st) to lowest (7th):

---

### 1. **Halveth‚Äôs Crown**  
_The First Terrace ‚Äî Seat of Firelight_

- **Function**:  
  The spiritual and political heart of Solrael. Home to the **Conclave Seat**, where high doctrine was debated and declared, and the **Temple of Unified Flame**, a shrine-temple devoted to the dominion of Sol and the harmonization of upper-god worship.  
  The **Hall of Light Archives** also resides here ‚Äî a sky-lit vault of pre-Exile records, solar scrolls, and sealed Ky manuscripts forbidden to all but the highest ranking archivists and voicebearers.

- **Access**:  
  Restricted to **high clergy**, **harmonists**, and **lineage-blessed citizens** ‚Äî those whose bloodlines have demonstrated divine favor through generations of Ky offerings.  
  Ordinary Kynari were not permitted access except during rare, city-wide Harmony Festivals.  
  > _Note: While the First Terrace is restricted to high clergy and lineage-blessed families, **Harmonists** ‚Äî spiritual technicians trained in Skyglass resonance ‚Äî are granted conditional access for tuning and maintenance. Many live on lower terraces and travel to Halveth‚Äôs Crown only when summoned by dome fluctuation cycles or shrine recalibrations._

- **Architecture**:  
  Gilded lattice towers curved like blooming flame petals. Floating mirrors tracked the dome‚Äôs inner surface and redirected sunlight into skyaltars. Roofs of **auric Skyglass** captured the true voice of the dome ‚Äî clearest and most resonant here.  
  Bridges of transparent mineral connected prayer-tiers and dome organs. Some walked barefoot in ritual, claiming they could feel the gods pulse beneath.

- **Unique Sites**:  
  - **The Flame Altar** ‚Äî An everburning Ky-fed brazier where high blessings were conferred.  
  - **The Harmonium Tower** ‚Äî A spiraling, chime-strung observatory used by Harmonists to attune the Skyglass lattice.  
  - **The Voicewell** ‚Äî A vast, circular opening into the Conclave chamber below. Echoes of divine declarations were fed upward into the dome itself.

- **Rituals**:  
  - **Sol‚Äôs Gaze** ‚Äî A daylight devotion where participants stood beneath mirrored pillars to receive the reflected gaze of Sol.  
  - **The Illuminae Trial** ‚Äî A secretive rite for selecting new Conclave members, judged not only by flame and Ky but the *resonance* of a candidate‚Äôs voice within the Voicewell.  
  - **Harmony Cycles** ‚Äî Dome recalibrations timed with astronomical conjunctions; entire terrace shifts into silence and synchrony as Harmonists tune sky-altars.

- **Myths**:  
  It is said that **Sol** first looked down upon this terrace and cast a beam of pure radiance that burned the first code into Skyglass ‚Äî the **Lex Ignis**, or Flame Script, now long lost.  
  Some say that the Dome itself is alive, and that the gods dwell within its mirrored lattice ‚Äî whispering through harmonic pulses only the trained can hear.

- **Gods Favored**:  
  - **Sol** ‚Äî Supreme Upper-God of radiance, sovereignty, and order  
  - **Ivraya of Tongues** ‚Äî Goddess of law and articulation  
  - **Vellisar the Revealer** ‚Äî God of clarity, exposure, and divine secrets

---

### 2. **Viresta Gate**  
_The Terrace of Judgment_

- **Function**:  
  The legal and spiritual crucible of Solrael. Viresta Gate was where divine will was interpreted into law ‚Äî both secular and sacred. It housed the **Ritual Courts**, **Ky Valuation Forums**, and **Birthright Hearings**, where ancestry and divine alignment were debated and confirmed.

  Disputes over Ky ‚Äî inheritance, crystallization integrity, transfer rights ‚Äî were resolved here by ordained **Songwrights**, who could ‚Äúread‚Äù resonance memory by tonal decoding.

- **Access**:  
  Open to the public during designated tribunal hours and ritual observances. Restricted chambers were guarded by **Lightbound Sentinels** ‚Äî trained adjudicators chosen from among the most neutral of terrace-born Kynari.  
  **Initiates**, often trained from adolescence, served as attendants, scribes, or ceremonial witnesses.

- **Architecture**:  
  White resonance-stone cut into crescent-shaped halls designed to amplify voice.  
  Great echo domes, often inscribed with **lexographic glyphs**, could ‚Äústore‚Äù spoken law as tonal archives.  
  Large public squares flanked each hall ‚Äî often used for Ky trials and open confession rites. At dusk, the terrace shimmered with subtle refracted light from the dome above, turning its pillars gold-pink.

- **Unique Sites**:  
  - **The Circle of Weighing** ‚Äî A sunken, amphitheater-like forum where disputed Ky fragments were sung into. The vibrations determined memory origin, purity, and divine ownership.  
  - **The Wells of Silence** ‚Äî Shallow basins filled with metallic sand that absorbed sound. Used in final rites, and occasionally in executions.  
  - **The Ember Gate** ‚Äî A ceremonial arch flanked by everburning braziers. Birthright challengers walked through firelight to have their Ky ‚Äúseen.‚Äù If the flame dimmed, their claim was rejected.

- **Rituals**:  
  - **Flame-Scourge Trials** ‚Äî Reserved for the spiritually accused. Involved ritual burning of Ky-offerings to test divine response.  
  - **Ky Disputes** ‚Äî Formal hearings where two claimants submitted opposing shards for song-decryption.  
  - **Name-Cleansing Ceremonies** ‚Äî Used to restore tarnished family lineages or erase forbidden ancestry. Not always voluntary.

- **Myths**:  
  It is said that the first laws were not written but **sung** ‚Äî gifted by Ivraya of Tongues herself. Viresta was her choir. Some claim that if one sings true justice within the Circle of Weighing, the gods still answer ‚Äî and sometimes interrupt.

- **Gods Favored**:  
  - **Ivraya of Tongues** ‚Äî Goddess of speech, truth, and mediation  
  - **Vaedros the Ledger** ‚Äî God of memory, balance, and reckoning  
  - Minor shrines to Sol, present but not dominant here

---

### 3. **Nurel‚Äôs Reach**  
_The Harmonist‚Äôs Ascent_

- **Function**:  
  The artisan and mechanical soul of Solrael. Nurel‚Äôs Reach was home to the **Artificer Guilds**, **Resonance Engineers**, **Pattern-Crafters**, and the builders of Skyglass infrastructure.  
  The city‚Äôs mechanical lifeblood ‚Äî lifts, bridges, harmonic relays ‚Äî was designed, tuned, and repaired here. Its lower workshops also produced the **dome harmonizers** used across Solrael.

  Though not officially spiritual, many in Nurel claimed their work was a form of worship ‚Äî tuning the physical to match the divine resonance.

- **Access**:  
  Open to all citizens, but tightly regulated by **Guild Seals** and workshop lords.  
  Only certified artisans could access the **deep forges** or the **central resonance vaults**, where sacred Skyglass was stored before use. Apprentices trained here from a young age, often through strict family lineages or god-bound sponsorships.

- **Architecture**:  
  Broad work-yards woven with channels of liquid Ky and heat vents. Buildings resembled massive foundry-hives ‚Äî each adorned with tower glyphs identifying guild, patron god, and workshop hierarchy.  
  Massive copper vent-rings opened at dawn and dusk to release steam and filtered fumes into the higher terraces above ‚Äî an ongoing point of tension with the Temple caste.

  Skyglass was used sparingly in architecture here ‚Äî embedded only in tuned panels or guild-inscribed conduits. Most surfaces were mineral-slate, bronze-clad, or soot-darkened.

- **Unique Sites**:  
  - **The Resoth Crucible** ‚Äî A dome-fed forge tuned to the harmonic hum of the Skyglass above.  
  - **Guildspire Twelve** ‚Äî A towering compound controlled by the Mechanists of Iunva, known for heretical experimentation and sealed floors.  
  - **The Thread Archive** ‚Äî A vast underground vault containing blueprints, mnemonic ciphers, and failed resonance patterns deemed dangerous or unstable.

- **Rituals**:  
  - **Forge Binding** ‚Äî The ritual attunement of a crafter‚Äôs Ky to their tools.  
  - **Resonant Calling** ‚Äî A once-a-cycle summoning for all guild initiates, held in the Crucible. Participants chant harmonic blueprints until one draws the ‚Äúdivine echo‚Äù ‚Äî a sign of god-favored skill.  
  - **Breaker‚Äôs Silence** ‚Äî A mourning rite for inventors or engineers lost to failed experiments. Tools are disassembled and left at the base of Skyglass pylons until the next cycle.

- **Myths**:  
  Some claim that **Iunva the Unseen**, an undergod or exiled upper-god, first gifted the Kynari with the knowledge of resonance-lock forging in Nurel.  
  Others believe the **spires themselves hum** during deep lunar alignments, and that the machines once moved on their own ‚Äî not by Ky, but by something older.  
  A buried tower beneath the Reach is said to predate Solrael and whisper in old machine-tongue.

- **Gods Favored**:  
  - **Iunva of Sparks** ‚Äî Goddess of crafting, risk, and recursion (sometimes classified as under-aligned)  
  - **Vaedros the Ledger** ‚Äî Respected here not for law, but for the patterns of memory  
  - **Arvakul** ‚Äî Minor deity of iron, breath, and heat-born instinct

### 4. **Yvara‚Äôs Span**  
_The Market of Faiths_

- **Function**:  
  Yvara‚Äôs Span served as Solrael‚Äôs **artery of connection** ‚Äî the primary nexus between upper and lower terraces. It housed **transit hubs**, **merchant piers**, and **market spires**, making it the most populous and economically active terrace in the city.

  The Span was also the center of **hearth-life** for the middle class: makers, transporters, traders, and minor priesthoods. Though not elite, its access to both the nobility above and the working terraces below gave it power through proximity.

- **Access**:  
  Freely accessible to most Kynari citizens. Permits were only required to access **Bridgeway Seals** (official Skyglass conduits between terraces) and shrine-altars aligned to upper-tier gods.  
  Many families lived and died entirely within the Span, never ascending or descending ‚Äî yet heard all gossip that passed between.

- **Architecture**:  
  Named for its great **arched skybridges**, Yvara‚Äôs Span was a lattice of motion. Suspended walkways, stepped canals, and floating glideplates crisscrossed the terrace, connecting atriums, dwellings, and trade-stations.  
  Buildings were **polished stone wrapped in ivy**, with balconies hung with wind-chimes made from discarded Ky-crystals and hollow Skyglass shards.  
  Transport fauna ‚Äî such as **breezewalkers** and **choral mules** ‚Äî were bred and stabled here, adapted to echo-heavy corridors and crowd-dense environments.

- **Unique Sites**:  
  - **The Viruun Ducts** ‚Äî A massive windshaft system that drew filtered air from the river below into upper terraces.  
  - **The Skywell Exchange** ‚Äî A domed trade-bazaar where Ky was both currency and commodity. Traders from every terrace met here under glowing resonance lanterns.  
  - **The Pillar of Sighs** ‚Äî A memorial column that recorded the names of those who died during terrace collapses or purge raids. New names were sung into it at dusk.

- **Rituals**:  
  - **The Bridgewalk** ‚Äî A coming-of-age ritual where youths crossed the five main skybridges alone at night, watched silently by family.  
  - **Hollow Echo Day** ‚Äî A silent marketplace held once every cycle to honor those lost in transit. No words spoken, only gestures, offerings, and quiet resonance.  
  - **Ky Veil Dances** ‚Äî Informal terrace ceremonies where traders and pilgrims tied colored ribbons to passersby to share prosperity or fate. Each color matched a god or virtue.

- **Myths**:  
  It is said the Skyglass bridges of Yvara were the first true ‚Äúbreaths‚Äù of Solrael ‚Äî allowing the terraces to speak, trade, and weep together.  
  Some claim the Viruun Ducts once echoed the laughter of an upper god called **Elariin**, now lost or devoured.  
  Traders believe certain bridges whisper omens in bad wind ‚Äî if you hear your name on the gust, you must turn back.

- **Gods Favored**:  
  - **Elariin the Open-Handed** ‚Äî Forgotten god of travel, wind, and laughter (shrine intact, worship diminished)  
  - **Vellisar the Revealer** ‚Äî Often petitioned by merchants seeking truth in deals  
  - **Sol** ‚Äî Always present, though his shrines were fewer here than above

---

### 5. **Auvira‚Äôs Crest**  
_The Shattered Terrace_

- **Function**:  
  Auvira‚Äôs Crest was known as a place of **quiet harmony**, **botanical devotion**, and **subtle dissent**. Often called the ‚ÄúTerrace of Bloom,‚Äù it housed many of Solrael‚Äôs **small shrines**, **scholar enclaves**, and **resonance gardens**. It was where mid-tier families‚Äîdevout but not dominant‚Äîlived lives shaped more by inquiry than by power.

  Before the Shattering, it had become an unnoticed convergence point for **those who studied what should not be studied**: under-god texts, relics from the Deep, and Ky fragments that resonated with unfamiliar chords.

- **Access**:  
  Fully open to citizens, including artisans, scholars, low-rank priests, and Skyglass maintainers. While not prestigious, Auvira‚Äôs Crest was considered one of the most **livable** terraces ‚Äî less smoke than Nurel‚Äôs Reach, less control than Halveth‚Äôs Crown, less noise than Yvara‚Äôs Span.

- **Architecture**:  
  Elegant but understated. Skyglass pylons rose like slender reeds from gardens of woven stone and hanging ivy.  
  Homes were small but ornately carved ‚Äî each featuring reflective sun-pools and **resonance chimes** tuned to private frequencies.  
  Bridges of translucent glass crossed green channels where birds nested and memory-lilies bloomed ‚Äî flowers said to sharpen thought when inhaled before prayer.

  The **Temple of the Third Light**, perched on the edge of the terrace, was the highest known shrine that welcomed prayer to both upper and under gods ‚Äî unofficially. Its destruction marked the symbolic beginning of the Exile.

- **Unique Sites**:  
  - **The Garden of Divergence** ‚Äî A crescent grove where Skyglass pylons were deliberately tuned to slightly off-harmonics, creating unusual light patterns.  
  - **The Echo Greenway** ‚Äî A walking path of memory stones where Kynari whispered their regrets into etched grooves ‚Äî each one silently held by the stone.  
  - **The Chamber of Unscripted Flame** ‚Äî A now-ruined observatory where rogue harmonists once experimented with alt-resonance tuning against Conclave edicts.

- **Rituals**:  
  - **First Bloom Reading** ‚Äî Each new cycle, local priests offered Ky-drenched soil to memory-lilies, interpreting the bloom pattern as a sign of divine approval.  
  - **Silent Harmonies** ‚Äî Weekly devotions where no one spoke aloud. The terrace resonated only with the tones of chimes, water, and birdsong.  
  - **Third Light Vigils** ‚Äî Held in secret after dusk, these ceremonies drew together dissidents and reformists who believed in a third divine path ‚Äî neither Sky nor Core, but something yet unspoken.

- **Myths**:  
  Many believe Auvira‚Äôs Crest was the **first terrace to hear the Under-Gods** ‚Äî not through speech, but dreams, fractures, and tones beneath the stones.  
  Some whisper that the Shattering was **not punishment**, but a signal ‚Äî a response to the terrace‚Äôs growing resonance with something buried too deep.  
  The children of Auvira were once called ‚ÄúBloom-born.‚Äù After the Exile, they became something else: **The First Casted**.

- **Gods Favored**:  
  - **Sol** ‚Äî Worshipped publicly, though devotion waned in later years  
  - **Virell of Roots** ‚Äî Lesser god of healing, growth, and introspection (suspected under-aligned)  
  - **Unnamed** ‚Äî Several shrines were unmarked or bore symbols unknown to the Conclave. Their names are now lost or forbidden.

---

### 6. **Arissen Hollow**  
_The Terrace That Forgot_

- **Function**:  
  Arissen Hollow served as a **forgotten limb** of Solrael ‚Äî once vital, now neglected. Originally built to house the **mineral laborers**, **Skyglass scrapers**, and **ash-vent technicians**, it became known over time as the **Terrace of Echoed Labor** ‚Äî where those without lineage or favor kept the city running beneath notice.

  By the final years before the Exile, the Hollow had become a strange hybrid of **utility and abandonment**, part functioning infrastructure, part ghost district. For some, it was a place to vanish. For others, a place to begin again.

- **Access**:  
  Technically open to all, but largely avoided by those from higher terraces. The stairways that led to Arissen Hollow were few and often poorly maintained, and the dome above had long since clouded. **Pilgrims**, **outcasts**, and **Ky-smugglers** passed through here in equal measure.

- **Architecture**:  
  Crumbling stone towers reinforced with scrap and copper paneling. Passageways cluttered with maintenance rigs, half-fused pylons, and rusted pulley bridges.  
  The **Skyglass density** here was low ‚Äî most of it scavenged, stolen, or shattered long ago. The resonance hum barely reached Arissen, making it feel quiet in a way that scraped at the ears.

  Many homes were **burrowed inward**, not upward ‚Äî built into old Skyglass support chambers, collapsed conduits, or the carved ribs of long-dead terrace fauna. Fungal light was more common than lanterns.

- **Unique Sites**:  
  - **The Dust Spire** ‚Äî A collapsed Skyglass tower whose base became an open market for relic fragments, illegal Ky trade, and low-end resonance surgery.  
  - **The Scorched Rung** ‚Äî A stairwell perpetually closed off by old fire barriers and chime-lock wards. Locals claim it leads to an abandoned shrine no longer recognized by any god.  
  - **The Pipe Choirs** ‚Äî A maze of wind tunnels where vagrants built shanties between resonance pipes that still half-sing when the dome shifts above.

- **Rituals**:  
  - **Echo Offerings** ‚Äî Instead of shrines, many placed Ky fragments into rusted valves or abandoned conduits, hoping the old gods ‚Äî or new ones ‚Äî might hear.  
  - **Naming Fires** ‚Äî Crude flame rites where the nameless or cast-out could speak a new name into burning scrap. The smoke would carry it to whomever might accept it.  
  - **Sleepless Reels** ‚Äî Communal hallucination rites using fungal tinctures and echo-sleep to experience memory playback from stranger Ky fragments.

- **Myths**:  
  It‚Äôs said that **Arissen Hollow was once higher** ‚Äî a noble terrace that fell into disfavor when its patron god vanished due to lack of offerings. In time, its history was erased from Conclave ledgers.  
  Some believe it is a **fracture-point**, where Solrael‚Äôs body was never fully healed.  
  A surviving myth claims one can still find the shrine of **Tirith the Withheld**, a god who refused to speak during the Conclave‚Äôs rise ‚Äî and who still listens from the cracks.

- **Gods Favored**:  
  - **Tirith the Withheld** ‚Äî Silent god of refusal, memory-holding, and cracks in faith  
  - **Vaedros the Ledger** ‚Äî Worshipped quietly in hopes of being remembered  
  - Numerous unnamed or outlawed gods once whispered in vents and fungus-choked tunnels

---

### 7. **Kareth‚Äôs Undermirror**  
_The Shadowed Root_

- **Function**:  
  Kareth‚Äôs Undermirror was the **lowest and least understood** of Solrael‚Äôs terraces ‚Äî both physically and spiritually. More cavern than city, it functioned as a **resonance waste basin**, a **forbidden archive**, and a **ritual exile zone** for those whose beliefs or behaviors became too strange for the upper terraces.

  Officially, Kareth housed **Skyglass purge chambers**, **harmonic overflow vents**, and the **crypt-shrines of misremembered gods**. Unofficially, it was where one went to disappear ‚Äî or to listen for something older than doctrine.

- **Access**:  
  Severely restricted. Even Harmonists required **triple-seal clearance** and **Conclave warding rites** to descend for tuning or observation. Yet many still found their way there: the desperate, the heretical, the chosen.

  After the rise of the Veiled Synod, rumors spread that some **Conclave dissidents** were quietly sent to Kareth ‚Äî not to be punished, but to be watched. Some never returned. Others returned speaking in mirrored phrases, claiming they had glimpsed the gods beneath.

- **Architecture**:  
  No clear urban planning ‚Äî more a **collision of half-built chambers**, collapsed pylons, and **submerged shrines**.  
  Skyglass here was cracked and over-resonant, humming in irregular pulses. Pools of reflective fluid ‚Äî likely a mix of condensed Ky, runoff, and mineral bleed ‚Äî formed in natural depressions, earning the terrace its name.

  Structures twisted around **old machines**, or perhaps the machines twisted around them. Many buildings were built downward rather than outward, like inverted towers. Carvings were older than Kynari memory.

- **Unique Sites**:  
  - **The Mirror Vault** ‚Äî A submerged Skyglass chamber said to reflect not the viewer, but the god watching them. Entry is often fatal to the unblessed.  
  - **The Humming Grave** ‚Äî A broken field of tombs and pylons, some still whispering prayers no living tongue has spoken in generations.  
  - **The Maw‚Äôs Crown** ‚Äî A cavern rim at the terrace‚Äôs southern edge, once sealed, now shattered. The beginning of the Deep Road. The end of Solrael.

- **Rituals**:  
  - **Reflection Vigils** ‚Äî Heretical rituals in which the faithful stared into dark pools while submerged up to the chest, seeking divine resonance through stillness.  
  - **Last Light Songs** ‚Äî A death rite for those who died unnamed. Their memory was sung into Skyglass walls, and their Ky allowed to drift.  
  - **The Veiling** ‚Äî Performed by Synod adherents: a ceremonial covering of the face and eyes before speaking the name of an Under-God aloud.

- **Myths**:  
  Some say Kareth is **not a terrace**, but a **wound** ‚Äî carved by the first war between Sol and the Core. Others claim that it is **not below** Solrael but **beside** it, folded like a second skin.  
  A forbidden story passed through Synod whisperlines says that the **first god ever buried** lies beneath Kareth, humming into the marrow of the world.  
  Others say the Dome never touched this terrace ‚Äî that it was always meant to be left in shadow.

- **Gods Favored**:  
  - **No gods openly worshipped** here during the height of the Conclave  
  - **The Core-born** ‚Äî Nameless, numberless, those aligned with recursion, silence, and resonance without light  
  - **Whispers of Iunva**, **Tirith**, and other forbidden names appear in etched scraps, half-songs, and fractured glyphs

---

## Society, Culture & Religion

### Social Structure

- **No formal castes**, but society was deeply stratified by **Ky-value**, lineage memory, and divine favor.
- Terraces were hierarchical: the higher the terrace, the more likely its inhabitants could access powerful gods or Ky-intensive rituals.
- **Ky-rich individuals** had greater access to education, healing shrines, and re-memory services.

---

### Ky & the Divine Economy

- **Ky** was all ‚Äî memory, energy, proof of life, and coin of the gods.
- Each Ky shard bore color and weight according to life lived:
    - *(0) Common ‚Äì Grey*  
    - *(1) Uncommon ‚Äì Green*  
    - *(2) Rare ‚Äì Blue*  
    - *(3) Epic ‚Äì Purple*  
    - *(4) Legendary ‚Äì Yellow*  
    - *(5) Mythic ‚Äì Orange*  
    - *(6) Unique ‚Äì Red*  
    - *(7) Forbidden ‚Äì Black*
- Ky was offered to shrines to **empower gods**. Some claimed gods *nested in the Skyglass* itself and absorbed offerings via resonance.

---

### Ritual Life

- **Temples**: Not public plazas ‚Äî these were sanctums, accessed only by initiates or sanctioned worshippers. Each god‚Äôs temple was guarded and acoustically tuned to their aspect.
- **Festivals**:
    - **The Kypouring**: Terrace-wide offering where families selected one shard from their lineage chest to feed the shrines.
    - **Flame Days**: Seasonal rites of alignment with Sol ‚Äî great sky-harmonies sung to the dome.
    - **The Still-Eclipse**: A silent observance where no light was allowed, symbolizing the humility before divinity.
- **Education**: Children trained to enrich Ky from birth. Instruction included:
    - Harmonic chanting
    - Memory reflection
    - Ritual experience simulation
    - Shrine-attuned apprenticeship

---

### Clothing & Identity

- Not class-based, but **god-aligned**.
- Each god had:
    - **Color schemes**
    - **Thread types** (e.g., mirror-thread, glowlace, obsidianfiber)
    - **Symbols**: carved into jewelry, sung into cuffs, woven into veils
- Follower garments reflected the **nature of the god** they followed.  
    - Sol‚Äôs faithful wore layers of golden silk with mirrored trim.  
    - Followers of the Archivist god might wear memory-scroll sashes or tone-etched copper bands.

## The Shattering & The Exile

On the **First Pulse of Glow 1, Cycle 0** (Core Reckoning) // **4th Day of the Ninth Moon, Year 5213 SE** (Solar Reckoning), the Skyglass dome above the Fifth Terrace ‚Äî *Auvira‚Äôs Crest* ‚Äî cracked.

The Pulse was felt. The Exile began.

It did not simply fall. It **resonated**. The dome screamed across the lower terraces, triggering harmonic dissonance that shattered pylons, sundered shrines, and collapsed Skyglass towers.

Resonance surges triggered failures in memory-sinks and overcharged conduits, causing structures to rupture inward ‚Äî not explode, but unravel.

The Solar Conclave declared it an act of sabotage by the **Veiled Synod**, an underground sect accused of offering Ky to Under-Gods ‚Äî beings long deemed heretical, corrupt, or myth. Within minutes, **gold-armored legions were in place**, executing flame-cleansings across Auvira‚Äôs Crest and its adjoining shrines.

Many now argue the troops were too quick to respond ‚Äî or too well positioned. Some claim the Conclave engineered the collapse itself, staging a divine catastrophe as a false flag to justify purging Synod influence and erasing rival gods.

Of the 9,000 Kynari who fled Solrael during the Shattering, approximately 6,000 reached the edge of the Maw.

Though many attempted to descend together, the path fractured quickly ‚Äî not just physically, but socially.

Some perished during the descent, but many more scattered into the Depths' infinite cavern systems, taking other tunnels, forgotten shafts, or crumbling conduits.

These groups would eventually found distant colonies, enclaves, and fragment-faiths ‚Äî the roots of what would become the Kin of the Casted.

This event, known simply as **The Exile**, marks the **beginning of Core Reckoning Cycle 0** and the **mythic divide between Surface and Depth**.

---

## The Veiled Synod

A heretical faith, or a resurgence of ancient truth ‚Äî accounts vary.

The Veiled Synod was not a single cult, but a **rising convergence of beliefs** centered around the Under-Gods. Its followers believed that true divine recursion came not from above, but from the Core ‚Äî and that the Pulse was not interference, but invitation.

Core tenets (as reconstructed):
- The surface gods were exiles, not rulers.
- Ky was not meant to ascend ‚Äî it was meant to **return**.
- Beneath the city lived gods who **remember**, not gods who shine.
- The Skyglass Dome was a prison, not a portal.

Most Synod texts were burned, but fragments remain in Hollow monasteries and Shrinekeeper archives.

## Interpretations & Factional Views

Solrael is not just a city. It is a symbol, and like all symbols, it shifts depending on who holds the memory.

| Faction | Interpretation of Solrael |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **Surface Loyalists** | A sacred homeland desecrated by lies. The Exile was an unjust purge. Solrael must be reclaimed and purified of Conclave tyranny. |
| **Solar Conclave** | The final bastion of divine light. The Exile was a necessary quarantine of heretical infection. Solrael is proof that only the righteous endure. |
| **Shrinekeepers** | A broken axis. Solrael fell out of balance ‚Äî not destroyed, but wounded. True harmony will not return until both sky and core are venerated again. |
| **Core Faithful** | A monument to arrogance. The Shattering was not sabotage, but **rejection**. The Pulse cast them out long before they cast out others. |
| **The Casted** | A lie made of stone and song. Solrael chose who would be remembered. We remember what they erased. We carry the gods they feared. |

## Aftermath and Present-Day Status

Solrael remains the capital of the Solar Conclave. Its shrines function. Its towers shine. The higher terraces remain closed to outsiders. Surface Loyalists report that new districts have been built atop the razed ruins of the Fifth Terrace ‚Äî districts where **no Ky flows properly**, and Skyglass hums dissonantly even when silent.

Access to Solrael from the colonies is nearly impossible. Yet the name still echoes in ritual, in dreams, in forbidden hymns.

Many shrinekeepers believe the city's dome will one day resonate again ‚Äî not in light, but in memory.

## Perspectives

Solrael is remembered differently by every culture that survived its judgment.

Some view it as sacred soil, others as a spiritual tomb ‚Äî a place where songs became weapons and memory became currency. Below are the prevailing perspectives held by the major factions of the world:

---

### **Surface Loyalists**  
> ‚ÄúThe sun remembers. And so do we.‚Äù

- Solrael is a stolen homeland ‚Äî a divine construct hijacked by the Conclave.  
- The Exile was not purification but **genocide** by fire and silence.  
- The Fifth Terrace must be retaken and rededicated to the true gods ‚Äî including those the Conclave feared.  
- Loyalists preserve forbidden maps, rituals, and even living lineages tied to Solrael's noble bloodlines.

---

### **Solar Conclave**  
> ‚ÄúOnly the faithful remain.‚Äù

- Solrael is the sacred center of the world ‚Äî the only true divine interface.  
- The Shattering was caused by corruption in the Ky offered by heretics.  
- The Exile was a **mercy**, allowing those infected with recursion to die in the dark.  
- The Dome now hums **purer than ever**.

---

### **Shrinekeepers**  
> ‚ÄúIt split because we did.‚Äù

- Solrael was once balanced ‚Äî a place where all shrines could be walked in peace.  
- The Fifth Terrace fell because the harmony between gods was broken.  
- Some shrines still thrum with memory from both upper and under.  
- The city must eventually be **reconsecrated** through unity, or left to rot into ash.

---

### **Core Faithful**  
> ‚ÄúIt was never yours.‚Äù

- Solrael was not cast down ‚Äî it was rejected.  
- The Pulse removed its blessing. The rest followed.  
- The Fifth Terrace was not shattered. It **peeled away** from the rot.  
- The city above is an echo of arrogance ‚Äî and echoes always fade.

---

### **The Casted Kin**  
> ‚ÄúSolrael chose. We remember.‚Äù

- Solrael was never ours. It was theirs.  
- When they feared what we had seen, they burned us from their memory.  
- Some of us were born beneath its dome. Others only died there.  
- Its name is not sacred ‚Äî it is a scar. But scars remember more than skin does.
