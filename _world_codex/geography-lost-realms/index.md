> “The sun burned the names from stone. The Core swallowed what was left.”

Before the Pulse, before the colonies, before the Deep became home, the Kynari lived in a world built for light — a world of towers and altars, of ritual cities and engineered skies. Much of it is lost, collapsed, or unreachable. But its influence lingers in language, architecture, and the bloodline memory of those who survived.

This section details the geography, ruins, and megastructures of the world as it once was — and the paths that led beneath it.

## Contents

### [The Surface](/thecastedkinweb/world-codex/geography-lost-realms/surface/)
The open world above the Maw. Now mostly unreachable, but still home to the Solar Conclave and the ruins of Kynari civilization. Loyalist factions still fight to reclaim it. Surface geography, sun cycles, and known remaining citadels are described here.

### [Solrael](/thecastedkinweb/world-codex/geography-lost-realms/solrael/)
The City of Light’s Grace. Once the heart of Kynari civilization — built across seven radiant terraces beneath a Skyglass dome engineered to sing with divine resonance. Though the Fifth Terrace was shattered in a catastrophic event known as the Shattering, the city itself remains intact and is still governed by the Solar Conclave.

Its role in the Exile is deeply contested. Loyalists see it as a stolen homeland. Shrinekeepers treat it as sacred but wounded ground. The Conclave calls it purified — a city cleansed of heresy, still guided by Sol’s authority.

### [The Maw](/thecastedkinweb/world-codex/geography-lost-realms/the-maw/)
A tunnel not carved, but revealed. The Maw spirals deep into the crust, opening pathways to the Core. Said to be a divine punishment, a gate of trials, or a womb of rebirth — depending on who speaks. The first exiles passed through here during the First Glow.

### [The Deep](/thecastedkinweb/world-codex/geography-lost-realms/the-deep/)
The vast subterranean realm where the colonies now cling to existence. Home to shrines, fungi-forests, god-burrows, and ruins from civilizations older than memory. Boundless, dangerous, and still largely unmapped.

### [Pilgrim Lore & Naming the World](/thecastedkinweb/world-codex/geography-lost-realms/pilgrim-lore-naming-the-world/)
The world once had a name — etched in Skyglass, spoken by the old priesthood, lost in the Exile. Some still search for it. Others believe it was never real, a fiction crafted by the Conclave to claim divine right. This page explores known references, recovered fragments, and conflicting names passed down through Ky rituals.

## Purpose of This Section

This section focuses on **pre-Exile geography**, ancient infrastructure, and the megastructures that defined Kynari civilization before descent. It sets the stage for:

- Understanding where the colonies came from
- Locating ruins, shrines, or factions tied to lost places
- Tracking myths about ascent, exile, and god-chosen cities

If you are looking for information on the present-day colonies and districts, visit the [Colonies & Regions](/thecastedkinweb/world-codex/colonies-and-regions/) section instead.
