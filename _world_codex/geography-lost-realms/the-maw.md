## Overview

The Maw is the only known surviving passage between the Depths and the surface world. A colossal descent tunnel partially formed, partially grown, and partially unknown, the Maw served as the path of the first exiles during the Shattering of Skyglass. Though physically anchored to the fractured rim of Solrael’s Fifth Terrace, the Maw now exists just as deeply in myth, memory, and contested belief.

To the **colonies**, it is the **wound** through which their ancestors fell.  
To the **Conclave**, it is a **scar**, sealed and cursed.  
To the **Core Faithful**, it is a **defilement**, a place where Ky was once wasted on the false sun.  
To the **Shrinekeepers**, it is a **threshold** — never closed, never resolved.

Despite its near-mythic status, the Maw is real. And it still breathes.

## History

Long before the Exile, the Maw was a **Ky extraction mine** carved into deep strata beneath Solrael. Veins of fossilized Ky and proto-Skyglass ran through the walls like bronchi, making the tunnels hum faintly with residual resonance — echoes of long-dead organisms, trapped in stone.

But it was not only energy the Maw offered — it offered **questions**.  
Strange glyphs, old machines, and subterranean anomalies began to appear along its deeper corridors. Some Kynari — especially among the scholar caste and minor faith sects — began to revere these anomalies, whispering of **forgotten intelligences**, of **divinities below**.

This troubled the Solar Conclave. As **upper-god devotion waned**, and signs of heretical alignment with the **under-gods** increased, the Conclave took action. The mine was sealed, records purged, and entrance criminalized. 

But knowledge endured — hidden by rogue scholars, preserved in whispered rites, and etched beneath tattoos.

When the Shattering struck, and fire rained from the dome, it was these remnants who led thousands to the forgotten edge of the Fifth Terrace. Word passed among the desperate:

> “There’s still a way down. The Old Way. The Deep Road.”

They named it then — not with reverence, but recognition.

**The Maw.**

## Physical Description

The Maw is not a tunnel in the traditional sense. It is an evolving corridor — part natural fault, part collapsed infrastructure, part unknown. Its walls are **smooth in some places, as if melted**, and **jagged in others**, with Skyglass-veined mineral seams pulsing faintly in the dark. These veins are considered the **proto-conduits** of Ky — the forgotten roots of what would become the surface’s Skyglass networks.

The **entrance mouth** is enormous, carved into the cliffside beneath the broken edge of Solrael’s Fifth Terrace. From there, the path descends in great **spiraling arcs**, **staggered ledges**, and **widening vaults**. Most notable is the **internal plateau**, a kind of sunken plaza within the first cavern, large enough to house thousands — the last place the exiles stood together before descending into separation.

Deeper chambers vary wildly:
- Some stretch into **open cathedral vaults** with crystalline dust frozen in the air.
- Others compress into **vein-like crawlspaces** that glow faintly, hot to the touch.
- Several corridors veer into **collapsed ruins** or fossilized remnants of a previous civilization — long erased from surface record.

Despite its size, the Maw gives the illusion of narrowing. The longer one walks, the more the silence presses in — and the more one forgets how large it truly is.

## Environmental Characteristics

- **Ky Resonance**:  
  The Maw holds ambient Ky, particularly in its walls and fungal growths. Most of it is inert, but during historic Pulse events — such as the First Pulse at the time of the Shattering — the resonance magnifies dramatically.

- **The Pulse**:  
  The Pulse is barely felt here, if at all. The descent seems **outside the rhythm**, or beneath it. Only one known exception exists:  
  > The First Pulse — Glow 1, Cycle 0 — was felt within the Maw.  
  > Some claim it awoke the walls. Others, the gods.

- **Shifting Structure**:  
  While not fast or volatile, the Maw does appear to **shift subtly over generations** — especially at deeper levels. This has made consistent mapping nearly impossible. Some believe it reacts to memory, devotion, or even fear.

- **Flora & Fauna**:  
  Life has found a way here — adapted to the currents between surface and Depth:
  - **Threadshrooms**: Long, root-like fungus that emits rhythmic pulses.
  - **Ky-blooms**: Fungal growths said to store micro-memories in color bursts.
  - **Glowleapers**: Skittish, soft-limbed creatures that can scale walls and vanish in tunnels.
  - **Shatter-gnats**: Insect swarms whose wings refract faint Skyglass light.

- **Known Exits**:  
  Only one confirmed exit exists — the mouth beneath Solrael’s Fifth Terrace.  
  Any other branches are either **sealed**, **collapsed**, or **lost to time**.

## Symbolism & Interpretation

The Maw is not just a tunnel — it is a **threshold in the collective memory** of the Kin of the Casted. It marks the final moment the Kynari stood beneath the sun, and the first moment they stepped into a world **without it**.

- To some, the Maw is a **mouth that swallowed their ancestors**.
- To others, it is the **birth canal of a truer people**.
- A few scholars claim it is neither descent nor exile — but **entry into the world’s deeper architecture**.

In dreams, it appears often as a spiral. In Ky-fragments, it echoes in tremors rather than images.

Many believe the **walls remember**, even if they do not understand what memory means in stone.

## Factional Views

### 🔹 **Core Faithful**
The Maw is a point of failure — where Ky was still tainted by the sun. They consider it **unclean**, its Pulse irregular. The faithful avoid the place, yet study it from afar, convinced that **offering Ky near the Maw risks distortion**.

### 🔸 **Shrinekeepers**
To the Shrinekeepers, the Maw is **a sacred ambiguity** — a place where neither the Core nor Sol holds dominance. Its existence affirms their core belief: that **balance must be preserved**, not purity pursued. Many pilgrimage there in secret.

### 🔺 **Surface Loyalists**
The Maw is a **sorrowful gate**, and sometimes a goal. It is watched obsessively, and some among the Loyalists believe it can be **reactivated, purified, or reversed**. Rumors persist of **returners** — individuals who tried to ascend and never came back.

### ⚫ **The Conclave**
Officially, the Maw does not exist.  
Privately, it is **guarded with severity**, monitored by inner clergy and Harmonist proxies. Its current seal is etched with binding symbols, many **derived from fractured Under-God script**, repurposed to keep “the rot” below.

## Present-Day Status

As of Cycle 3.4 (Year 170 AE), the Maw remains **sealed at the surface**, though not irrevocably.

- It is believed to be **monitored by Conclave remnants** stationed near the old Solrael border.
- In the Depths, **its lower mouth remains open**, though nearly inaccessible due to **geological shifts, warding, and colony avoidance**.
- **No sanctioned faction uses the Maw** as an active path — though whispers persist of rogue explorers attempting the climb.

Modern maps either **omit it entirely**, mark it with abstract spiral glyphs, or note it with a single phrase:

> “Here we lost the sky.”
