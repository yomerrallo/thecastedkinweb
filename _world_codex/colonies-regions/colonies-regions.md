# The World Beneath — Colonies & Regions

> “We descended to survive. But the world below was already waiting.”  
> — *Jaid, The Third Architect*

The known world of *The Casted Kin* is layered — vertically, ritually, and narratively.

The **World Codex** divides this structure into **Nine Regions**, each made of **four Zones**, from the **Sun-Buried Surface** to the mythic machine-heart known as the **Core**.

---

## Region Structure

Each **Region** contains:

- Four **Zones**, each representing a unique biome or phase of descent
- A **Boss Gate** (typically in Zone 4) marking the threshold to the next Region
- Shifting **Ky behavior**, **Pulse conditions**, and **creature evolution**
- Cultural echoes, lost shrines, and environmental instability increasing by depth

## Regional Overview

| Region | Name                  | Status            | Description |
|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1      | **Surface Realm**     | **Partially Defined** | Solrael, ruins, the Maw |
| 2      | **The Threshold Reaches** | *To Be Revealed*   | First true Depth region |
| 3      | *TBD*                 | *Unrevealed*       | Fragmented shrine biomes |
| 4      | *TBD*                 | *Unrevealed*       | Fungal territories, echoing spires |

| 9      | **The Core**          | *Unmapped*         | Origin point of Ky resonance |

## Region 1 – Surface Realm

> “Solrael did not fall. It cast us out and kept the sun for itself.”

The Surface Realm is now myth. But traces remain — charred temples, ghost-cities, fractured memories sealed in Skyglass. Region 1 represents the uppermost layer of the world, with Solrael as its apex.

| Zone | Name                        | Biome / Theme                                       | Codex Status |
|------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1    | [**The Maw**](/thecastedkinweb/wiki/geography-lost-realms/the-maw/) | Reentry point from Depths; ritual tunnel of exile | **In Progress** |
| 2    | *Ashwalk Ruins*             | Conclave-blasted ruins and heretic scars           | *Planned*    |
| 3    | *Skybrand Sanctums*         | Trial-shrines, occupation zones, solar towers      | *Planned*    |
| 4    | [**Solrael**](/thecastedkinweb/wiki/geography-lost-realms/solrael/) | Skyglass city, divine seat of power                | **Published** |

## Region 2 – The Threshold Reaches

> “It wasn’t descent. It was unraveling.”

The first true Depth region. Few maps agree. Many of its Zones shift in rhythm with the Pulse.  

| Zone | Name              | Biome / Theme               | Codex Status |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| 1    | *TBD*             | *To Be Discovered*          | *Unwritten*  |
| 2    | *TBD*             | *To Be Discovered*          | *Unwritten*  |
| 3    | *TBD*             | *To Be Discovered*          | *Unwritten*  |
| 4    | *TBD (Boss Gate)* | *Under-God shrine threshold?* | *Pending*  |

---

## Region 5 – The Colonies

> “We did not build down here. We survived long enough to forget the word surface.”

The midpoint of the vertical world. Region 5 is the **cradle of modern Kynari society**, the battleground of faiths and philosophies.

| Zone | Name            | Biome / Theme             | Codex Status |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 1    | *Sunderhold*    | Largest colony-fortress   | *Planned*    |
| 2    | *Shrinehaven*   | Faith and faction crosspoint | *Planned*  |
| 3    | *Marketveins*   | Black-Ky trade hubs       | *Planned*    |
| 4    | *Silent Ring*   | Forgotten tunnels, Hollow sightings | *Planned* |

---

## Region 9 – The Core

> “It does not wait. It remembers through us.”

Not yet mapped. Believed to contain:
- **Godless Shrines**
- **Skyglass root-lattices**
- **Ky recursion anomalies**
- **The Pulse Well**

---

## Next Steps

- Define **The Maw** (Zone 3, Region 1) Codex entry
- Name/describe Regions 2–4 and Zones within
- Develop Colony Zone details
- Eventually: Visual SVG map or vertical layer diagram
