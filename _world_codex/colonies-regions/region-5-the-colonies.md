*“Sanctuary never was. Survival is all that remains.”*  
— Fragment from an exile prayer, etched in blood-Ky, Cycle 1.8

---

## Overview

The Colonies are the heart of the Depths — not because it is whole, but because it is broken in just the right ways. It is where the Kin of the Casted finally stopped running. Where they dug into the stone, raised shrines from scavenged pylons, and dared to name this place **home** — even if the gods never agreed.

It is not a safe haven. It is a crucible.

A fractured territory of cave-colonies, fragmented loyalties, black-market power struggles, and divine desperation — The Colonies are the closest thing to civilization the known Depths offer, and yet morally the farthest from salvation.

Its light comes from Skyglass pillars pulsing with stored Ky — vaults of soul-light hoarded by each colony to stave off the dark. When a colony’s vault dims, so too does its warmth, its favor, its divine attention.

Colonies do not fall from war.

They **fade**, **fail**, and **are forgotten**.

---

## A Cracked Civilization

Where some texts still remember sky and flame, The Colonies have forgotten everything but **debt**, **violence**, and **prayer-as-coin**.

Each colony is carved into natural caverns and artificial veins, dug out over generations. No two look alike — the Depths reshape themselves slowly, and so too do the Kin.

Colonies are self-governed, semi-autonomous, and **ruthlessly competitive**. While borders are informal, disputes are constant — **for food, relics, Ky, or divine favor**.

## Pillars of The Colonies Society

### The Trade Council (Fractured)
A loose confederation of old colony leaders, shrine agents, and merchant-kyn. Technically responsible for regulating Ky exchange, shrine neutrality, and inter-colony law.  
In practice, it is **corrupt, divided**, and mostly ceremonial — until someone breaks the unspoken rules too publicly.

### Ky-Tithe Collectors
Every functioning colony pays **a tithe of Ky** to the gods it serves — collected through shrines, enforced by priest-scribes and harmonized debt-keepers.  
Non-payment results in **withdrawal of divine favor**, economic sanctions, or in extreme cases... unmaking.

### Rogue Cult Enclaves
On the outer ridges of the region live unregistered colonies — heretics, outcasts, failed sects, even Hollow remnants. Some offer Ky to unknown gods.  
Some **burn it** just to watch the skyglass scream.

### Castoffs & Ghost-Diggers
Failed raiders. Crippled scouts. Disgraced families.  
The castoffs make up nearly a third of The Colonies’ population. Most live in cracked corridors or shrine margins, trading whispers for food or **memories for rent**.

## Why the Colonies Fight

- **Ky is finite.** The Depths are rich but cruel, and harvesting Ky always costs blood.
- **Divine Favor is unstable.** Gods turn their gaze to those who feed them — and away from those who don’t.
- **Mythic Ascension.** Every colony believes they might someday ascend... through wealth, through war, through worship.

Add to that centuries of **feuds, betrayals, and broken accords**, and peace is not just unlikely — it is **unaffordable**.

---

## Unspoken Realities

- **No one returns from above.**  
  The Maw is sealed. The road to the surface is watched. Those who try to ascend either vanish or are branded Returnist.

- **New colonists are born... or sent.**  
  Some are the children of survivors. Others are **banished** from higher or lower regions — political exiles, criminals, pilgrims who lost their way.

- **Gods speak less here.**  
  The Pulse is faint. Shrines sometimes flicker.  
  When colonies go dark, the last thing heard is often a **whisper**, not a scream.

## What Comes Next

Each colony is a city-state, shrine, and fortress rolled into one. In the following sections, we will explore:

- Major and minor colonies
- Factions vying for control within and between them  
- The role of shrines, vaults, and Skyglass resonance  
- Ky harvesting economics, rituals, and black market trade  
- PvP culture: raids, sabotage, and honorless diplomacy  
- How the Pulse is interpreted in a region where it is barely felt

## Major and Minor Colonies

Each colony is a fractured echo of Solrael — a remnant of faith, lineage, or desperation. Some are centuries old, rooted in the Exile. Others are less than a Cycle from collapse.

While hundreds of cave-colonies sprawl across the region, a few have grown powerful enough to be known by name — whispered in markets, chanted in raids, etched into shrine stone.
