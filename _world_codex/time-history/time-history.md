## Overview

The Depths do not mark time like the Surface did.

Since the Shattering and the Exile, new systems of reckoning have emerged — some precise, others adapted in desperation. Two calendars persist: the **Solar Reckoning**, once used across the Surface and still preserved by the Conclave in Solrael, and the **Core Reckoning**, developed in the Depths after the descent.


What we know is scattered:  
Some dates are recorded in shrine-ink and stone fragments.  
Others drift — part legend, part truth.

This section is divided into three parts:

---

## Index

### 1. [Time Reckoning](/world-codex/timeline-and-history/time-reckoning/)
*Glows, Pulses, Cycles, and the problem of conversion.*

- Solar Reckoning (SR)
- Core Reckoning (CR)
- Before/After Exile (BE / AE)
- Surface-to-Depth calendar translations
- Shrine-based vs Civil-based timekeeping
- Known calendar errors

> How many Cycles has it really been since the Exile? And why do the gods count differently?

---

### 2. [History](/world-codex/timeline-and-history/history/)
*What is remembered. What is recorded.*

- Pre-Exile Surface (Solrael and its collapse)
- The Exile and descent through Maw
- The carving of the Depths
- Founding of the Colonies
- Rise of major factions
- Pulse-based anomalies and religious events

> Many of these events are sourced from shrine archives or recovered memory-Ky. Accuracy is relative. Absence is often deliberate.

---

### 3. [Myths, Legends & Forbidden Histories](/world-codex/timeline-and-history/myths-legends/)
*Stories no shrine dares canonize — but everyone knows them.*

- Lio, the Old Wanderer
- Sayren the Unheard
- The Whisper That Dug Tunnels
- The Maw's Crown and the Ghost Below
- The Ash-God Who Ate Its Followers
- What the Pulse Remembers When It Sleeps

> These tales shift. No two colonies tell them the same way. Some may be false. Some may be prophecy.

## Epochs of the Casted Kin

The timeline of the world is divided into two major reckonings:

- **Solar Reckoning (SR)** — Surface calendar used before the Exile  
- **After Exile (AE)** — The dominant calendar of the Depths  
  → Expressed in **Cycles**, **Glows**, and **Pulses**  
  → Current date: **Cycle 279.1**, Year **307 AE**

---

## On Time and Reckoning

- The Surface reckoning (Solar) counted days, years, and dynasties  
- The Core reckoning (Depths) counts **Pulses**, **Glows**, and **Cycles**
- Conversion:
  - **1 Glow = ~1 day**
  - **1 Cycle = 400 Glows ≈ 1.1 Solar Years**
- **Current Time: Cycle 279.1**, equivalent to **Year 307 AE**
