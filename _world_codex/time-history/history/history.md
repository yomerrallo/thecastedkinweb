## Overview

The history of the Casted Kin spans three broad arcs:

- **The Solar Age** — Surface-bound empires, godborn revelations, and the rise of Solrael.  
- **The Exile Era** — The Shattering, the Maw, and the descent into the Depths.  
- **The Cycle Age** — Post-Exile civilizations, rise of the Colonies, and the fracturing of faith.

Much of this history is **oral, fragmented, or contested** — rewritten by shrine factions, erased by war, or altered by Pulse anomalies. The following records are drawn from shrine fragments, Vault logs, Pulse-anchored texts, and Pilgrim testimony.

## The Solar Age  
_Pre-Exile Era (?? – Year 0 AE / SR ~7050)_

> “We did not lose time. We abandoned it.”  
> — Archivist Velren, Shrine of Hollow Names

- **[SR ~3000]** — *The Sculpting of Solrael*  
  Myths describe the Skyglass dome and lattice towers being shaped by divine mandate.

- **[SR ~5300]** — *Formation of the First Conclave*  
  Shift from tribal offerings to centralized Ky taxation via shrines.

- **[SR ~6120]** — *Worship Divide Begins*  
  Emerging cults deviate from Sol-worship, calling attention to under-gods and Ky anomalies.

- **[SR ~6202]** — *Sealing of the Maw*  
  Conclave closes the Deep Road beneath Auvira’s Terrace. Official reasoning: unstable Ky veins.

- **[SR ~6293 / Year 0 AE]** — *The Shattering*
  Auvira’s Crest cracks during the First Pulse of Glow 1, Cycle 0. Solrael’s lower terraces collapse.  
  Exile begins. Surface calendar abandoned by the Depth-bound.

## The Exile Era  
_The Shattering & Descent (Cycle 0–10)_

> “There’s still a way down. The Old Way. The Deep Road.”  
> — Eyewitness account, Shattering Day, Glow 1, Pulse 3


- **Glow 1, Pulse 0, Cycle 0** — *First Pulse Recorded Below*  
  The Skyglass dome of Auvira's Crest fractures. Tremors spread across the Fifth Terrace.  
  Panic erupts; a mob forms at the terrace’s southern edge. Civil order dissolves within hours.

- **Glow 1–2** — *The Maw is rediscovered*  
  Scholar-castes guide a flood of survivors to the sealed gate. The Deep Road reopens.  
  Thousands perish in the chaos or are lost in fractured terraces.

- **Glow 3** — *First waves descend into the Depths*  
  The Kynari cross the Maw’s Crown. Echoes of their descent travel back as warnings and rumors.

- **Glow 4–6** — *The Conclave closes the upper shrines*  
  Remaining authorities declare silence. Last known shrine-tithe is burned.  
  Return becomes impossible.  

- **Cycle 0.1–1.0** — *The Descent Era begins*  
  The Pulse stabilizes. Early descent groups fracture. Some form camps in caverns; others vanish.  
  Solrael ceases contact. The first Depth-born shrine fragments are recorded.

- **Cycle 2.4** — *Founding of the Shrinekeepers*  
  Orira declares Ky sacred regardless of god, defines shrine-flow as mnemonic river.

- **Cycle 3.8** — *The Ky Fracture War*  
  Rogue Kynari sabotage shrine collectors. Surface Loyalists are accused.  
  Multiple colonies lose contact in retaliation strikes.

- **Cycle 5.1** — *Kael disappears beneath Vault 7*  
  Marked in some texts as the mythic beginning of the Core Faithful movement.

- **Cycle 10** — *Colonies formally counted*  
  Sixteen Depth settlements acknowledged by shrine-led census.  
  First generation of Depth-born Kynari reaches maturity.
