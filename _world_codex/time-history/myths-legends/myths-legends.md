## Overview

This page holds **unverified accounts**, **oral traditions**, **sacred contradictions**, and **tales preserved only in Ky**.  
Some of these stories may be echoes of truth. Others may be lies repeated so long, they grew roots.

## Mythic Fragments & Recurring Legends

### ☼ The Original Offering  
Said to predate the First Cycle. A myth where Sol weeps Ky into the lungs of the first Kynari, not as a gift — but as a test.  
→ Retold differently by Core Faithful, Shrinekeepers, and Loyalists.  
→ Some versions claim the original Kynari **never died**, but was split into the nine great gods.

---

### ☾ The Song Below All Songs  
Pilgrims speak of a **resonance buried beneath the Pulse** — a frequency not felt, but remembered.  
→ Those who survive its echo forget their names, but retain *perfect memory*.  
→ Some claim this is how the Core communicates when it chooses not to speak.

---

### ✧ The Returnist Pact  
Suppressed scripture suggests the Returnists made a deal with a god that **never had a shrine**, only a mouth.  
→ Once followed openly in Surface’s final days. Now punishable by silence.  
→ Some believe its shrine still pulses beneath the dead domes of Solrael.

---

### 🩸 The Hollowing of Vault 7  
Believed to be the birth of deeptech Harvesting.  
→ A godless faction discovered a vein of liquid Ky and **fed it into a thinking machine**.  
→ Kael was last seen near the site. His followers refuse to speak of it.

---

### 🔥 The Burned God  
Some shrines flicker with a name no Harmonist can pronounce.  
→ Said to be an upper-god that **fell**, landing in the Maw and igniting the tunnels for three full Glows.  
→ The Shrinekeepers mark this event as the beginning of "Ky Panic" — when gods began hoarding attention.

---

### 🐚 The God Beneath the Skin  
Whispered by castoffs and lunatics.  
→ A presence that can **live inside Ky**, mimicking those recently dead.  
→ Most Vaultkeepers dismiss the idea — but some colonies ban second-hand Ky.

## Forbidden Histories & Banned Records

---

### 🕯️ The Skyglass Betrayal  
A legendary event where a Harmonist altered a shrine's Skyglass to **redirect Ky** to a dead god.  
→ Believed to have triggered the collapse of a surface city.  
→ No records remain, but a surviving chant-cycle hints at its location.

---

### 🌒 The Third Exile  
No official record mentions it.  
→ But fragments in early Colony Vaults speak of **a second breach of the Maw**, centuries after the first.  
→ In some tales, this exile was not downward — but deeper *sideways*, into a fold of the Depths not mapped by pilgrims.

---

### ✴ The Blank Shrine  
A structure found at the edge of Region 7.  
→ Covered in Rootglass veins but **without any Ky resonance**.  
→ No one who prays there remembers what they asked for. Some never return.
