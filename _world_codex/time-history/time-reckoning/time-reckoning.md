## Overview

Time in the world of the Casted Kin is not merely chronology — it is myth, memory, and necessity. With the fall of the Surface and the severing of shared systems, time itself fractured. What remains are two coexisting but divergent calendars:

- The **Solar Reckoning (SR)** — a relic of the Surface, used in shrine archives and older inscriptions.
- The **Core Reckoning (CR)** — the living clockwork of the Depths, measured by the Pulse and used throughout the Colonies.

A third system also persists in spoken form:
- The **Exile Split**: Before Exile (BE) and After Exile (AE), used by historians and pilgrims.

Each reflects not only a different geography — but a different relationship with memory, rhythm, and divine absence.

## Core Reckoning (CR)

The standard timekeeping system in the Depths.

- **Pulse** — A single beat of the Core. Used for short intervals.  
  ≈ 1 hour

- **Glow** — 24 Pulses. Equivalent to a full day/night cycle in the Depths.  
  ≈ 1 day

- **Cycle** — 400 Glows. A full year by Depth measurement.  
  ≈ 1.1 Solar years

- **Generation** — 10 Cycles. Commonly seen as the span from birth to parenthood.  
  ≈ 11 Solar years

**Current Date:**  
→ **Cycle 279.1 CR**  
→ Equivalent to **Year 307 AE**

### Solar Reckoning (SR)  
_The calendar once used by Solrael and all Surface cities._

- Based on solar years, lunar phases, and constellations.
- Still used in Solrael and preserved in pre-Exile documents, shrine archives, and early Conclave codices.
- Time in the Depths is sometimes converted back to SR for reference — especially in the study of shrine inheritance and forgotten events.

**Year 0 AE = Year [SR unknown] at the moment of Exile**  
(The exact correspondence varies depending on the source; most agree it was near the end of the Fourth Era of Solrael.)

> “We did not lose time. We abandoned it.”  
> — Archivist Velren, Shrine of Hollow Names

## BE / AE: The Exile Split

A cultural shorthand used in both Surface ruins and Depths colonies.

- **BE (Before Exile)** — Refers to events before the Shattering and descent into the Maw.
- **AE (After Exile)** — Begins the moment the Casted Kin entered the Deep Road.

Used colloquially and in oral history, especially by Shrinekeepers and Pilgrims.

## Notes on Conversion

| Unit           | Core Reckoning (CR)  | Approx. Surface Time (SR) |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 Pulse        | 1 Core hour           | ≈ 1 hour                   |
| 1 Glow         | 24 Pulses             | ≈ 1 day                    |
| 1 Cycle        | 400 Glows             | ≈ 1.1 Solar years          |
| 1 Generation   | 10 Cycles             | ≈ 11 Solar years           |

## Known Calendar Anomalies

- **Shrine Drift** — In certain regions (especially Region 8), Cycles may run fast or slow due to Pulse distortion.
- **Pulse Cessation Events** — Short periods where the Pulse was unfelt; caused unrest and loss of chronological continuity.
- **Maw Transition Gap** — The passage through the Maw is unrecorded in time — some claim they aged years, others not at all.
- **Cycle Errors** — Several colonies use alternate dating starting from their founding instead of from Exile.

---

## Reckoning in Practice

Not all colonies agree on the current date. Some mark time from the collapse of their founding shrine. Others use a relic — a broken clock, a sky-shard, or even the decay of a god’s whisper.
