### Canonization & Memory Encoding

Shrines do not write history.  
They **encode memory**.

A shrine "canonizes" a story not through decree, but by **repetition**, **offering**, and **acceptance by the god** it serves. When enough **Ky is offered** in relation to a specific tale, moment, or belief — and the shrine does not reject it — that memory becomes **anchored** in its resonance pattern.

This process is **not always intentional**.  
Sometimes, a recurring myth — whispered by pilgrims or repeated in prayer — gains traction simply because enough followers **believe**, and enough Ky has flowed while the belief was present.

Such canonized memories are:
- **Amplified** during shrine readings or rituals
- **Copied** between shrines aligned to the same god
- Used as **legal or spiritual precedent** by shrinekeepers and faithful factions

But not all stories are canonized.  
Some are **too dangerous**, **too heretical**, or **too splintered in memory** to be accepted.
