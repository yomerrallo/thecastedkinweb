## What is Skyglass?

**Skyglass** — called *Rootglass* in the Depths — is a naturally occurring **resonant crystal** that forms the invisible latticework of the world.

It is not just a substance. It is a **system** — one that **carries, stores, and transmits Ky**, the divine energy present in all living beings.

These **filament networks** run beneath Solrael, through the Colonies, and down toward the mythic Core — like the **veins of a buried god**, like **mycelium in living stone**.

---

## Names & Dialects

- **Skyglass** is the name used by the Surface-born: harmonists, scholars of Solrael, and the Conclave.
- **Rootglass** is the name used in the Depths — by exiles, colonists, and shrinekeepers who no longer believe in the "sky."

Though the two terms refer to the same crystalline substrate, their **cultural associations** differ wildly.

> "You call it Skyglass because you still think the gods live above you.  
> We call it Rootglass because it’s already beneath your feet."  
> — Unknown Shrinekeeper, Colony Cinderfold

## Physical Properties

- Translucent, prismatic, and often **pulsing faintly** with Ky resonance.
- **Non-reflective**, despite its gleam — absorbs and diffuses light rather than bouncing it.
- Brittle when dry, **flexible when harmonized**.
- Can sing. Can hum. Sometimes **responds to prayer**, or dreams, or memories.

Skyglass filaments can be **grown, tuned, or shattered**, but never truly created.

## Distribution

Skyglass is not evenly spread. It is **denser near shrines**, near Ky vaults, and in zones where the Pulse can be felt clearly.

Some known concentrations:

- **The Dome of Halveth’s Crown** (Solrael)
- **The Maw’s Crown Veins**
- **Vaultlight Spires** in major colonies
- **Relic Shrines** deep in Region 6 and beyond

## Function & Use

Skyglass serves as:

- A **Ky transmission medium** — melting crystalized Ky into fluid form and carrying it toward a designated god.
- A **storage material** — holding memory-imprints, ritual sequences, or forgotten names.
- A **power conduit** — for shrine mechanisms, harmonist tools, or ancient devices.

In game terms, Skyglass also appears in:

- **Colony vaults**, powering defenses, lights, and shrine-favor
- **Dungeon tech**, such as gates, seals, and memory-locks
- **Crafting recipes**, especially for harmonist gear and memory-weapons

---

## Behavior & Mysteries

Skyglass does not obey normal geology:

- It **grows** in some places, shrinks in others.
- It is **"dead"** when severed, but **"quick"** when connected to the grid.
- It can **store voices**, **leak memories**, or **redirect Ky offerings** if corrupted.

The Pulse is stronger where Skyglass density is highest — leading some scholars to believe the material is **tuned to the gods' rhythm**, or perhaps is part of their body.
