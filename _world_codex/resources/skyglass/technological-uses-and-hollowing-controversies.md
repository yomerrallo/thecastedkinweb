### Ky-Driven Technology

While shrines remain the dominant interface for divine exchange, **Ky-powered technology** has become increasingly prevalent — especially in the Depths, where survival often outweighs reverence.

Devices, tools, and even weapons powered by Ky include:

- **Ky-Conduits**: Tools that channel crystallized Ky into energy for lighting, construction, or locomotion.
- **Infusion Chambers**: Used to implant or blend harvested Ky into living hosts or constructs.
- **Ky-Lensed Optics**: Tactical devices for scanning relics, shrines, or individuals with residual memory signatures.
- **Pulse-Bound Wards**: Defensive constructs powered by Ky resonance, designed to repel Hollowed or shrine anomalies.

These technologies often blur the line between sacred and profane. While some colonies regulate them strictly, others openly embrace their use — especially those disconnected from reliable shrine access.

### The Hollowing Debate

**Hollowing** is the process by which Ky is extracted **before** it crystalizes — often via machinery, shrines altered beyond their original purpose, or entities bred for that task.

Though efficient, Hollowing is widely regarded as dangerous — both ethically and metaphysically.

**Controversies surrounding Hollowing include:**

- **Identity Erasure**: Liquid Ky extracted prematurely often results in irreversible personality loss in the donor.
- **Divine Interference**: Gods may reject Hollowed Ky, claiming it lacks resonance or bears “false echoes.”
- **Core Infection Theories**: Some scholars claim Hollowing disrupts the Pulse, creating regional dead-zones.

### Harvesters and the Black Forge

Certain machines, known only as **Harvesters**, are designed specifically to Hollow. Ancient and partially self-repairing, they operate deep below Region 5 — or within rogue sectors abandoned by the gods.

Many refuse to approach them. Others barter with them.

A few even **worship** them.
