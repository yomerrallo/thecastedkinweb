## Theories of Origin  
*“We shape what we remember. But Ky shapes us first.”*  
— Sayren the Unhoused, Cycle 0.9, before the descent

---

Where Skyglass — and Rootglass — came from is still hotly debated across sects, colonies, and castes. Some theories are theological, others scientific, and a few are outright heretical.

Each tells us more about the speaker than the truth.

### 1. The Divine Lattice (Core Faithful Doctrine)  
Skyglass is believed to be the **first exhale of Core** — the exo-god below all gods.  
It formed the veins of the world so Ky could be born and returned, like a divine circulatory system.  
To the faithful, Skyglass is **sacred infrastructure**: meant for tribute, never tampered with.

---

### 2. The Sol Threads (Loyalist View)  
Surface loyalists teach that Skyglass is the **light-thread of Sol**, embedded deep within the earth by the Upper-God to bring light to darkness.  
In this view, the farther one travels from Solrael, the more corrupted Skyglass becomes — gradually turning to Rootglass.  
To damage it is to damage divinity.

### 3. The Precursor Residue (Scholar-Fragment Theory)  
A more secular theory suggests that Skyglass is the **technological fossil** of a civilization long gone — not divine, but designed.  
Rootglass, in this telling, is a **mutation or degradation**, still half-alive but no longer understood.  
Harvesters, shrines, and even the Pulse may be **machines**, misinterpreted by religion.

### 4. The Resonant Mirror (Shrinekeeper Interpretation)  
Shrinekeepers believe Skyglass is not from the world — but from **the echo of it**.  
A resonant substrate that forms wherever enough memory, emotion, or sacrifice converges.  
This theory explains why some Skyglass veins **appear suddenly**, or why others disappear after great trauma.  
It is not mined — it is **called into being**.
