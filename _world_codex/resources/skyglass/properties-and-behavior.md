**Skyglass and Rootglass** are materials defined less by chemistry and more by **behavior**.

They are not mined — they are **listened to**.  
They are not melted — they are **coaxed**.  
They do not burn — they **remember fire**.

### Physical Properties

- **Semi-Organic Structure:**  
  Appears crystalline, but with **living memory coils** detectable only through Ky-resonance mapping.

- **Fracture-Memory:**  
  Broken segments often retain **memory imprints**, releasing brief sensory echoes (heat, sound, light) when touched.

- **Luminescence:**  
  Emits ambient glow based on **Ky proximity**, emotional frequency, or shrine synchrony.

- **Phase Reactivity:**  
  Becomes temporarily **malleable or fluid** when exposed to concentrated offerings, dream-Ky, or Pulse surges.

---

### Behavioral Traits

- **Resonant Alignment:**  
  Shifts tone and hue based on the user’s **devotion**, **emotional state**, or shrine affiliation.

- **Selective Flow:**  
  Ky does not pass through all Skyglass equally. Certain veins **refuse** corrupted or non-tributary Ky, turning inert or hostile.

- **Harmonic Echoes:**  
  In specific formations (especially vault chambers), it can echo sounds from **past offerings**, creating **haunted architectures**.

- **Living Circuitry:**  
  In its densest roots (especially in Vaultlight pillars), it acts like a **living circuit** — powering machines, shrines, or light-fields.

---

### Instability Factors

- **God Hunger:**  
  Veins near unfed shrines have been known to **shiver**, **sing**, or **fracture** in the presence of excessive Ky reserves.

- **Trauma Ghosts:**  
  Rootglass that absorbed heavy offerings (e.g., mass death, heretic flame) may store **corrupted emotional signatures**, replaying them intermittently.

- **Biome Variants:**  
  Behavior changes drastically across biomes. In fungal biomes, it absorbs moisture. In fossil zones, it petrifies and ceases glow entirely.

Skyglass does not **serve**.  
It **remembers**, **reacts**, and occasionally, **refuses**.
