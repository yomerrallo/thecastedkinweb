## Notable Relics & Cathedrals  
*“Some glass does not reflect. It remembers.”*  
— Orira the Writeless, Sketchbook Fragment, Cycle 1.3

---

Throughout both Surface and Depth, certain Skyglass and Rootglass formations have achieved mythic or geopolitical importance. Whether constructed, discovered, or grown, these sites serve as **power centers**, **pilgrimage zones**, or **forbidden relic vaults** — and are often contested.

---

### ✦ The Mirror Vault (Fifth Terrace, Solrael)  
A submerged Skyglass chamber said to reflect not the viewer, but the **god watching them**.  
Entry is often fatal to the unblessed. Rumored to be **reactive to false prayer**.

---

### ✦ The Ash Spire (Colony: Vireth Hollow)  
A rootglass obelisk scorched black but **never cool to the touch**.  
Locals claim it holds the stored Ky of an entire fallen colony.  
Often used for **rogue offerings** during blood rites.

---

### ✦ The Tangle Choir (Depths near Region 7)  
A natural Rootglass lattice that hums at irregular intervals.  
Harmonists believe it **records ambient emotion**, and some pilgrims report hearing **the voices of their dead** when meditating nearby.

---

### ✦ The Fracture Shrine (Unmarked Zone, collapsed coordinates)  
Destroyed during an early Ky War.  
What remains is a jagged spiral of Rootglass and char — where offerings either vanish without resonance or return **multiplied and corrupted**.  
Used by **Heretic Cults** and outlawed across all major colonies.

---

### ✦ The Vaultlight Cradle (Colonies, multiple)  
Standardized chamber structures built around large Rootglass pillars that store and emit **colony-held Ky**.  
Each Vaultlight is distinct, but all require **tuning rituals** and **guard rotations**, as they are frequent targets for sabotage or theft.
