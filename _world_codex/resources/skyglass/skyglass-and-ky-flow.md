*“It doesn’t carry the gods. It carries what the gods crave.”*  
— Harmonist doctrine, uncirculated fragment

Skyglass — and its deep-lattice counterpart, **Rootglass** — forms the circulatory system of Ky throughout the known world. To most, it is invisible. To harmonists, shrinekeepers, and certain awakened beings, it hums. Not with voice, but with direction.

These lattice-like veins thread through both Surface and Depth, converging in shrines, vaults, and ancient cores. Through them, **Ky moves — not randomly, but with memory and intent**.

Each shrine functions as both **conversion chamber** and **resonance valve**:

- When **crystallized Ky** is offered, the shrine’s harmonic plates — typically constructed from refined Skyglass or Rootglass — melt it back into **liquid form** through vibrational tuning.
- This liquefied Ky then enters the **glass-vein network**, traveling along **frequency-aligned paths** toward its intended deity.

The process is not instantaneous — and not without risk.

### Shrine Flow Mechanics

- The **strength** and **purity** of a shrine directly affect Ky transmission.  
  Cracked latticework, corrupted tuning forks, or disputed god-rights result in **Ky-bleed** — a loss of energy, misdelivery, or even haunting feedback loops.

- When multiple shrines in proximity draw on the same vein, the **signal degrades**, leading to memory-echoes, flickering flame, or conflicting god-responses.

- **Unregistered shrines** may send Ky into **dead channels**, where it may coagulate, vanish, or attract resonance anomalies.

### Ky Current Theories

| Phenomenon         | Description                                                               | Notes                                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Resonance Drift     | Ky loses velocity in areas of low-faith density.                          | Causes shrine flickering or divine silence.           |
| Ky Collision        | When opposed Ky streams intersect, instability or feedback can occur.     | Sometimes weaponized in shrine sabotage.              |
| Loopback Flux       | Ky fails to transmit and returns to the bearer unchanged.                 | Interpreted as divine rejection or fractured selfhood. |
| Wandering Echo      | Old Ky fragments drift the lattice, drawn to similar experiences.         | Basis for lost soul myths and haunted shrines.        |

### Lore & Belief

To the faithful, the flow of Ky through Skyglass is proof that the gods remain tethered — not by body, but by hunger.

To the heretic, it is a revelation:  
**The gods do not command worship. They require it.**

Some say the Pulse itself follows these same veins, or perhaps pulses because of them. Others claim Ky predates the gods entirely — and that the lattice remembers its true master, still dreaming beneath the world.
