Shrines are not altars. They are **machines** — built of **Skyglass**, **memory-metal**, and **harmonic bone**, designed to convert, channel, and **attune Ky to divine frequency**.

Each shrine acts as an **interface** between mortal offerings and divine reception, functioning both as **amplifier** and **translator** of will. Though often sacred, shrines are deeply practical — and in many cases, **dangerously modifiable**.

---

### Architecture of Belief

No two shrines are identical. They are built from whatever can be scavenged, adapted, or inherited — but each requires three core components:

- **The Lattice Core**: A chamber of refined Skyglass or Rootglass. It processes the offered Ky and syncs it to a god’s resonance.
- **The Flame Relay**: A light-conductive filament system that visually mirrors the intensity and purity of offerings.
- **The Harmonic Fork(s)**: Resonance tools — musical, mechanical, or organic — that align the Ky’s frequency to that of the desired deity.

Together, these elements allow the shrine to determine **intent**, **source**, and **value** of the Ky, and in response, trigger flame, whisper, or godly manifestation.

### Godlink Calibration

Shrines must be periodically tuned — a task carried out by **harmonists**, or in rare cases, **god-touched acolytes**. Failure to recalibrate may result in:

- **Ky Misdelivery**: Ky may be absorbed by unintended entities or lost in Rootglass drift.
- **Flame Fade**: The visual response of the shrine dims or vanishes entirely.
- **Echo Break**: The shrine replays old prayers, looping past intentions instead of recognizing the present.

Some shrines are **exclusive**, attuned to a single deity. Others are **multi-aligned**, allowing colonies to shift allegiance or balance offerings between multiple gods — at the risk of **divine interference** or **resonance corruption**.

---

### Heretical Modifications

Not all shrines remain as built. In the Colonies and the rogue fringes, modified shrines are common:

- **Split-Cores** that direct offerings to multiple gods simultaneously
- **Silenced Shrines** used to store Ky without transmission — often for black market trade
- **Inverted Shrines** that burn Ky instead of offering it, creating pulses that disrupt local flow or trigger divine backlash

These practices are rarely sanctioned, but **difficult to prove** unless a shrine is dismantled.
