In the Depths, **Skyglass** is not just renamed — it is **reframed**.

The term **Rootglass** refers not only to the material, but to its **mythic function** in the underworld. Where Surface-dwellers see it as a divine lattice reaching upward, colonists and Depth-faith sects see it as something **buried**, **entangled**, and **omnipresent** — like the **roots of the world**, or the **bronchi of some dreaming body**.

### Core Concepts

- **Rootglass is not inert.**  
  It is reactive, temperamental, and highly sensitive to Ky flow, especially in zones where gods have been long neglected or overfed.

- **Rootglass often sings.**  
  Pilgrims describe harmonic pulses, low tones, and in rare cases, **dream-bleeds** when traveling near dense veins.

- **Not a mirror of Skyglass — but its other side.**  
  Some scholars suggest Rootglass veins are not separate at all, but the **underside** of Skyglass — the dark half of its memory.

### Known Variants

In the Depths, the material manifests differently than on the Surface:

- **Braided Rootglass:**  
  Thick, woven filaments found deep in shrine-chambers. Often tangled, humming, or wet with condensation.

- **Glassmoss Strands:**  
  Microscopic Rootglass veins clinging to ceilings or creatures — nearly invisible unless burned or harmonized.

- **Shrine-Slicks:**  
  Melted Rootglass remnants, sometimes still whispering. Used in forbidden rites and Hollow infusions.

### Folk Beliefs

- **Rootglass grows hungry when ignored.**  
  Some colonies leave offerings near dull veins to “keep the flow sweet.”

- **It can remember faces.**  
  Depth-faith whisper that Rootglass recognizes repeat travelers, altering tone or heat when passed by the same soul more than once.

- **It fractures the Pulse.**  
  Some regions report **interrupted Pulse sequences**, as if Rootglass chooses not to transmit certain god-signals.

Rootglass is not a material to harvest lightly.  
It is **sacred**, **uncertain**, and in some cult circles — **alive**.
