## Overview

A **Ky Vault** is the **core reservoir of soul-light** in any functioning colony — a **shrine-infused containment structure** that stores crystallized Ky not only as currency, but as fuel, light, and offering.

Most Vaults resemble **tall Skyglass spires** or **hollow-core pillars**, embedded at the physical center of the colony.  
They pulse with stored Ky — flickering with every tithe, transaction, or sacrifice.

The Vault is not symbolic. It is survival.

## Purpose & Function

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Light Source** | Emits low-frequency glow that stabilizes deeper colony zones and wards off hollow-spawn |
| **Shrine Conduit** | Routes offerings to the gods via Skyglass root-threads |
| **Energy Reserve** | Powers high-tier colony defenses, transport gates, and infusion devices |
| **Faith Index** | The Vault’s brightness reflects the gods’ favor — and the colony’s standing |

## Construction

Most Ky Vaults are built from scavenged or traded **Skyglass**, often **vein-fused with Shrineglass** from collapsed temples.

They are encased in:

- Ritual-bound housing (stone, bone, or alloy)
- Memory-sealed locks (readable only by Shrinekeepers or Vault-Wardens)
- Channeling spines to connect with outer structures

No two are identical.  
Some colonies even **name** their Vaults as sacred entities.

## Vault Dimming

When a Vault begins to dim, it signals more than economic trouble.

- **Low Ky levels** weaken shrine functions and defense wards.
- **Gods may turn their gaze elsewhere**.
- **Black rot** — a form of spiritual entropy — can creep through shrine filaments.

Some vaults **hum warnings** before flickering out. Others… just go silent.

---

## Collapse & Theft

A dead vault is a colony without breath.  
When a Vault is broken or stolen (it has happened), consequences include:

- Shrine blackout
- Mass hollowing of colonists
- Instant god-abandonment
- Collapse of local trade pacts

## Variants & Upgrades

Over time, colonies can modify their Vaults with rare components:

- **Ky Binders** — to prevent theft or leakage
- **Resonant Flutes** — to lure wandering gods
- **Deepglass Weaves** — to stabilize offerings in distant regions
- **Echo Chambers** — allow vaults to speak back, in pulses or dreams

Some vaults… remember.  
And some refuse new owners.

## In-Game Mechanics (Optional Meta-Notes)

- **Vault upgrades** unlock buffs, passive income, and god-favor bonuses
- **Ky input/output** determines daily resource gain and shrine performance
- **PvP raids** target vaults — defenders can use traps, decoys, or curse backlashes
- If your **Vault goes dark**, shrine-linked units may refuse to act
