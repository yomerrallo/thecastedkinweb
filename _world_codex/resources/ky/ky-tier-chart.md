Not all Ky is created equal.

While every living being is seeded with Ky at birth, its **hue**, **clarity**, and **tier** reflect how a life was lived, and how its echoes have compounded — even beyond death.

The **Hue-Tier System** below represents a unified scale used by shrinekeepers, traders, vaultmechs, and harmonists to evaluate Ky by:

- **Color** (hue resonance)
- **Emotional-mnemonic depth**
- **Tier rank** (common to forbidden)
- **Potential uses** and divine response

## Hue-Tier Spectrum

| Tier | Hue         | Description | Mnemonic Echoes | Lore & Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **0** | Gray-Dull   | Common      | Regret, numbness, disuse | Faintest shards. Found in inactive zones or among unremarkable lives. Fade quickly. |
| **1** | Green       | Uncommon    | Curiosity, growth, adaptation | First true signal of experience. Common among scouts, exiles, or young raiders. |
| **2** | Blue        | Rare        | Loyalty, discovery, burden | Seen in committed kin. Indicates meaningful choice, early sacrifice. |
| **3** | Purple      | Epic        | Glory, vengeance, sorrow | Strong personalities, blood-marked lives. Shrines react strongly. |
| **4** | Gold        | Legendary   | Revelation, belief, sacrifice | Rare and radiant. Often linked to historic figures or shrine-blessed events. |
| **5** | Orange      | Mythic      | Echoes of multiple lives, war-memory, deep love or loss | Feared and revered. Some gods refuse them. Others hoard them. |
| **6** | Red         | Unique      | Singular experiences beyond comprehension | Bound to legendary items, colonies, or god-touched kin. Rarely tradeable. |
| **7** | Black       | Forbidden   | Heresy, goddefiance, fractured identity | Illegal to hold. Dangerous to vault. May speak back if broken. |

## Interpreting the Scale

- Children and newborns often begin near **Tier 1–2**, regardless of age — their Ky is **potential-rich**, even if unused.
- Aging without impact often leads to **Tier 0–1** shards.
- Echoes persist **after death** — Ky can inherit memories, increasing **tier post-mortem** through inheritance, fusion, or shrine-channeling.
- **Unique and Forbidden tiers** are sometimes believed to carry full memory ghosts, or partial identities, within.

## Shrine Alignment

Gods are drawn to certain hues — and repelled by others. Most shrines **resonate stronger** with Ky whose hue aligns with their nature.

| God / Pantheon       | Preferred Hue(s) | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Sol (Upper-God)**         | Gold, Blue      | Rejects Black shards |
| **Core (Under-God Network)** | Purple, Red     | Accepts impurity and excess |
| **Ivraya of Tongues**       | Blue, Orange    | Resonates with layered memory |
| **The Veiled Ones**         | Black, Red      | Only usable through Veil shrines |
| **The Forgotten**           | Gray, Black     | Accept loss, reject clarity |
