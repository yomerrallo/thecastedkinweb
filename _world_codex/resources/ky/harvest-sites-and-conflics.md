### The Ky-Rich Zones

Ky is not evenly distributed throughout the Depths. Certain regions — often near dormant shrines, collapsed conduits, or biomechanical rootglass structures — become hotspots of crystallized Ky sediment or residual fluid traces.

Known types of sites include:

- **Shard Beds**: Natural accumulations of crystallized Ky, often buried beneath collapsed cathedrals or fossilized fauna.
- **Pulse Pockets**: Anomalous areas where the Pulse accelerates Ky maturation, making it easier to harvest.
- **Bone-Laced Hollows**: Regions dense with remains from past conflicts, layered in ghost-Ky and spectral residue.
- **Echo Chasms**: Cavernous voids where sound triggers Ky reactivation — often used for trap-harvesting.

Such zones are rare, unstable, and **violently contested**.

### Inter-Colony Warfare

Because Ky determines survival, sovereignty, and divine favor, most wars between colonies are ultimately resource wars.

Conflicts often erupt over:

- **Access to shard veins**
- **Control of abandoned or unstable shrines**
- **Ownership of Pulse-aligned tunnels**
- **Smuggling routes for forbidden tech**

Raids are frequent, short, and brutal. Some colonies specialize in **stealing Ky**, while others specialize in **making sure it never leaves the shrine.**

Treaties are fragile. Alliances shift with the gods.

### The Forbidden Zones

Certain harvest sites are declared **off-limits** by Conclave edicts, shrinekeepers, or ancient godbound law. Entering these places is a direct spiritual offense — punishable by curse, banishment, or hollowing.

Rumors persist of:

- **Living Ky**, too dense to be stable
- **Harvest cores** that devour rather than store
- **Ky loops**, where sacrifice is endlessly replayed to trap divine attention

Some colonies ignore the warnings.

Most regret it.
