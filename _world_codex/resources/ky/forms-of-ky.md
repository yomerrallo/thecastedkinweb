## Overview

Ky exists not as a fixed substance, but as a **continuum** — shaped by the state of the vessel, the depth of the experience, and the manner of release.

Whether flowing through the living or captured in shrine-tithes, **Ky shifts states**. These forms are not just physical — they carry **ritual, mnemonic, and economic implications**.

---

## Fluid Ky

### ✧ State:
- Found in **living Kynari**, Ky-infused fauna, and certain shrines.
- Warm, luminous, and slow-flowing — visible beneath the skin of the living, especially along the forehead channel, where it naturally accumulates and pulses with experience.
  
### ✧ Characteristics:
- Highly volatile and **resonant to emotion**.
- Best extracted immediately post-mortem.
- Retains **raw experiential density**.

### ✧ Use Cases:
- **Infusion rituals**, forbidden tech grafts, soul-channeling devices.
- Cannot be stored long without degradation or Hollow risk.

## Crystallized Ky

### ✧ State:
- Solid, faceted. Cools into **shards**, **fragments**, or **cores** almost immediately after death
- Color, hue, and clarity vary depending on life lived.

### ✧ Characteristics:
- Durable. Can be hoarded, traded, sacrificed.
- Sometimes still **warm to the touch**.
- Occasionally contains **echoes** — dream-residue or behavioral shadows.

### ✧ Use Cases:
- Standard **shrine offerings**.
- Used as **currency** and in **vaultlight** systems.
- Can be read, burned, broken, or even embedded.

---

## Ky Dust & Ash

### ✧ State:
- Crushed or eroded crystallized Ky.
- Found at old shrine sites, collapsed vaults, and battlegrounds.

### ✧ Characteristics:
- No visible glow, but some trace memory remains.
- **Unstable in high concentration** — reacts strangely with skyglass.

### ✧ Use Cases:
- Alchemical catalysts.
- Illegal use in **Ky-fume inhalation rituals**.
- Occasionally **re-condensed** into low-grade shardglass.

---

## Dormant Ky

### ✧ State:
- Found in certain **ancient relics**, **forgotten corpses**, or **sealed conduits**.
- Neither fluid nor crystal — inert, yet not lifeless.

### ✧ Characteristics:
- Can be reawakened through **Pulse exposure** or advanced shrine harmonization.
- Rare and unpredictable.

### ✧ Use Cases:
- Artifact activation.
- Catalyst for shrine reconsecration.
- Target of many **pilgrim myths** and forbidden experiments.

---

## False Ky

### ✧ State:
- Synthetic or stolen Ky. Created through mimicry or corruption.
- Sometimes mistaken for real Ky in low-light vaults.

### ✧ Characteristics:
- May shine, but contains **no true echo**.
- Can trigger shrine **backlash** or **god-rage** if offered.

### ✧ Use Cases:
- Fraud, sabotage, or war trickery.
- Ingredient in **hollowing experiments**.
- Occasionally tolerated in **non-faithful enclaves** where gods no longer watch.
